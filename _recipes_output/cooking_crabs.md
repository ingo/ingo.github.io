This guide provides instructions on how to cook various types of crabs. The cooking times vary depending on the type and size of the crab. Always remember to cook in water at 3.5% salinity to match ocean water for the best results.

### Ingredients

* Crabs (Dungeness, Rock, Spider, Box)
* Water with `3.5%` salinity

### Directions

#### Dungeness Crab
1. Dungeness Crab, scientifically named Cancer magister, is a popular seafood choice found along the West Coast of North America. It's known for its sweet and tender meat, especially from its legs and claws. The crab has a broad, smooth, and hard shell, which is purplish-brown in color and turns bright orange when cooked.
2. For whole, cook `1.5-2lb` crabs for `15 minutes`, `3lb` for `20 minutes`.
3. For cleaned, cook for `12 minutes`.

#### Rock Crab
1. Rock Crab, often found in rocky coastal areas, is smaller in size compared to Dungeness Crab. It has a hard, rugged exoskeleton with large claws. The meat is flavorful, though there's less of it compared to larger crab varieties.
2. For whole crabs, cook `1-1.5lb` for `12 minutes`, `2lb` for `15 minutes`.

#### Spider Crab
1. Spider Crabs are unique in appearance with long, spindly legs reminiscent of a spider, hence the name. They can be found in various parts of the world, with some species residing in shallow water and others in deeper sea regions. The meat is delicate and slightly sweet.
2. For whole crabs, cook for `18-20 minutes`. Adjust time by a few minutes less if the crab is cleaned.

#### Box Crab
1. Box Crabs are named for their boxy, square-like appearance. They have a relatively hard shell, and their meat is known for being succulent and rich. They usually reside in sandy and muddy bottoms.
2. For whole crabs, cook `1.5-2lb` for `14 minutes`, `2.5-3lb` for `18 minutes`.

  2. Lift the apron (the flap on the underside) and remove.
  3. Insert a thumb or finger under the shell, lifting it away from the body.
  4. Discard the gills and rinse the greenish-brown tomalley (liver) if desired.
  5. Break the crab into halves and rinse under cool water to remove any remaining debris.
