This recipe is adapted from Darina Allen's cookbook, "How to Cook." It's a versatile method of baking fish on a sheet pan in the oven, which can be applied to a variety of whole flat fish, including flounder, Dover sole, brill, or turbot. While the fish is baking, make a big green salad and, if you like, chill a bottle of dry white wine, like a sauvignon blanc.

### Ingredients

* `1` whole flounder or other flat fish on the bone (about 2 1/2 pounds), gutted
* Water, as needed
* `1` leek, thinly sliced
* `4 tbsp` unsalted butter
* Juice and finely grated zest from `1` lemon, plus optional lemon wedges for serving
* `1 1/2 tbsp` finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, oregano and/or thyme leaves (or your favorite herb combination; if substituting dried herbs generous 1 teaspoon total), plus optional herb leaves for serving
* `2` cloves garlic, finely grated or minced
* `1 tsp` chopped capers

### Directions

1. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
2. Rinse the fish and clean the slit by the head thoroughly. Using a sharp knife, cut through the skin around the edge of the fish where the fins meet the flesh. Do not cut deeply into the flesh. Be careful to cut neatly and to cross the side cuts at the tail or the skin will be difficult to remove later.
3. Lay the fish on a rimmed sheet pan and add a scant 1/2 inch of water. Add thinly sliced leeks into the water. Bake for 20 minutes, depending on the size of the fish, checking it after 15 minutes. The water will evaporate as the fish is cooked, but some should still be in the pan at the end. If the pan dries completely, the fish will stick to the pan, so add more water as needed.
4. To check whether the fish is cooked, lift the flesh from the bone close to the head where the flesh is thickest; it should lift off the bone easily and be opaque.
5. A few minutes before the fish is ready, melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl, using short 10-second bursts, or in a small saucepan over medium heat. Then stir in the lemon juice and zest; parsley, oregano and/or thyme; and garlic.
6. Pick up the skin down near the tail and pull it off gently (the skin will tear but should come off in long pieces). Serve the fish from the sheet pan, pouring off any remaining water, or transfer it to a warmed, rimmed platter. Spoon the herbed butter on top. Sprinkle the capers and more fresh herb leaves on top and serve with lemon wedges, if using.
7. NOTE: Ask your fishmonger to scale and gut the fish. This baking method allows you to cook it with the head on or removed.

### Notes

- The water could be replaced by court bouillon, or at least a little wine and some aromatics.
- Cut down on butter by making something more like a vinaigrette.
