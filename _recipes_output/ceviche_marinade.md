Literally translating to "tiger's milk," leche de tigre is a critical part of Peruvian ceviche: The mix of citrus, chiles, aromatics, and fish stock flavors and gently "cooks" the raw fish. The classic one is probably the most versatile and the one used most often at Ceviche. Nikkei Tiger's Milk is a unique tiger's milk recipe best suited for Nikkei-style ceviches or tiraditos. Rocoto Tiger's Milk is a spicy tiger's milk recipe best paired with strongly flavored fish and seafood.

Leftover marinade can be turned into a cocktail. See notes.

### Notes

- To turn the leftover marinade into a cocktail: In an ice-filled shaker, combine the leche de tigre, tequila, and hot sauce. Shake well until the shaker feels cold, then pour over ice into a chile-salt-rimmed glass. Garnish with celery shoots and papaya if desired, and more hot sauce to taste.
