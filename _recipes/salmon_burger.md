description: When made with fresh, wild salmon, these burgers are heavenly, but it
  works well with frozen salmon too. Err on the side of chopping the pieces smaller
  rather than larger, and make sure the salmon is very dry, as if it's wet, the burgers
  won't stick together well.

### Ingredients

* `20 oz` salmon fillet, cut into 1/4-in dice
* `1 tbsp` Dijon mustard
* `1 tbsp` chopped fresh dill
* `To taste` salt
* `To taste` pepper
* `As needed` mayonnaise or tartar sauce
* `4` Brioche or other buns

### Directions

1. Gently combine the salmon, mustard and dill in a bowl. Add salt and pepper. Form into four patties, each about 1" thick. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
2. Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. When hot, cook the burgers for 3-5 minutes per side. 5 minutes per side will yield a well-cooked burger.
3. Toast the buns, spread with mayonnaise or tartar sauce, and top with burgers.
