description: This banana rum gelato has an ultra-rich, chewy texture from slowly simmered
  overripe bananas and heavy cream. Dark rum adds a touch of decadence. Chill the
  base thoroughly before churning for the smoothest texture. It keeps well frozen
  for at least a month. Letting the banana mixture cool completely before freezing
  is crucial for the creamiest gelato possible. Overripe bananas contribute intense
  banana flavor. The rum provides a boozy backbone without being overpowering. Simmering
  the banana puree concentrates the flavor while the alcohol keeps it from freezing
  too solidly. Allowing it to chill fully produces the creamiest possible texture.
  The bananas and rum provide serious flavor.
