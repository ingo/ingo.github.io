description: This traditional tzatziki recipe learned in Athens makes the definitive
  version of the creamy cucumber yogurt dip. The key is draining the yogurt to achieve
  an ultra-smooth, spreadable texture accented by fresh garlic, olive oil, vinegar
  and mint. Letting the yogurt drain overnight results in an especially lush dip without
  any unwanted watery whey. The garlic, olive oil and mint take it to another level
  versus store-bought. Serve with warm pita and vegetables.
