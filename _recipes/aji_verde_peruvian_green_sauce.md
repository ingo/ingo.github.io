It's made from fresh cilantro, aji amarillo peppers, huacatay (black mint), and queso fresco blended into a creamy, spicy green sauce. It pairs wonderfully with grilled meats, roasted veggies, empanadas, or bread.

### Ingredients

* `1` whole lime juiced
* `2 tbsp` olive oil 
* `1/2 cup` good-quality mayonnaise (such as Hellmann's)
* `3 oz` queso fresco or blanco
* `2` serrano peppers ends trimmed 
* `1 bunch` cilantro with the leaves removed and stems discarded
* `4` garlic cloves peeled 
* `2` green onions ends trimmed and roughly chopped
* `2 tsp` [huacatay paste](https://amzn.to/2UB17Hw) (optional)
* `1 tbsp` [aji amarillo paste](https://amzn.to/2rWkGkD) (optional)
* `1/4 tsp` kosher salt

### Directions

1. To a blender, add the lime juice, olive oil, cheese, mayonnaise, serrano peppers, cilantro leaves, garlic cloves, green onions, huacatay paste, aji amarillo and salt. Blend for about 1 to 2 minutes, until very smooth. At first the cilantro leaves won't be totally smooth, but keep the blender running and it will eventually become cohesive and smooth.
2. Give it a taste and adjust the salt according to your liking. Keeps in the fridge for up to a week.

### Notes

1. If you have a super high powered blender such as a Vitamix or Ninja, etc, it can process a lot of the stems. If you don't, I suggest to remove all of the cilantro leaves.
2. I would suggest to add the liquids to the bottom of the blender and then add the cilantro on top. It helps combine all of the ingredients.
3. To make this Whole 30, eliminate the cheese and replace it with a bit more Whole 30 compliant mayonnaise.
