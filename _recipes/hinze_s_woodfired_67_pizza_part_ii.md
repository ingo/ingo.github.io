This pizza recipe is a fantastic exploration of dough fermentation. The Caputo Pizzeria flour is left to ferment for either 24 or 48 hours, creating a unique flavor and texture. The oven is fired with dry beechwood, adding a smoky touch to the pizza. This recipe yields 10 240g pizza balls, perfect for a gathering or a pizza party!

### Ingredients

* `1412g` 00 flour (Caputo Pizzeria)
* `946g` of 22Â°C Tap water
* `1.4g` fresh yeast
* `42g` salt

### Directions

1. Combine the flour, water, yeast, and salt in a large bowl.
2. Mix until a dough forms.
3. Let the dough ferment for 24 or 48 hours at room temperature.
4. After fermentation, divide the dough into 240g balls.
5. Preheat your oven with dry beechwood.
6. Roll out each dough ball into a pizza base and top as desired.
7. Bake in the wood-fired oven until golden and crispy.

### Notes

- You can use a pizza dough calculator (like ooni or PizzApp) to calculate your pizza dough. If you want to make a stone oven bread, just combine two pizza balls and form them into a long loaf. It's a simple variation with a great taste!
