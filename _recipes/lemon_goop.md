This Lemon Goop is a versatile sauce that can add a tangy and sweet flavor to a variety of dishes. It's a great way to use up those extra lemons and add a burst of citrus to your meals.

### Ingredients

FOR THE GOOP AND SYRUP:

* `6` large lemons
* `1 ½ cups` granulated sugar
* `2 teaspoons` fine sea salt

FOR THE VINAIGRETTE:

* `6 tablespoons` olive oil
* `2 tablespoons` goop syrup
* `2 tablespoons` goop
* `2 tablespoons` sherry vinegar
* `2 tablespoons` cider vinegar
* `1 teaspoon` honey
* Salt and pepper, to taste

### Directions

1. Make the goop and syrup: Remove the zest from 3 lemons, taking care not to include any white cottony pith. Coarsely chop the zest, and set aside.
2. You use the segments from all 6 lemons, so cut away any rind and pith on each of the lemons, so that the fruit is exposed. Slice between the membranes to release each segment.
3. Add the sugar, sea salt and 2 cups water to a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Drop in the segments and the chopped zest, bring back to a boil, then lower the heat so that the syrup simmers gently. Cook for about 1 hour, at which point the syrup will have thickened and the lemons will have pretty much fallen apart.
4. Strain the syrup into a bowl. Transfer the fruit mixture to a mini food processor or a blender, or set in a measuring cup if using an immersion blender. Add 1 tablespoon of the syrup to the fruit mixture, and whir until you have a smooth, glistening purée. Add more syrup as needed to keep the fruit moving and to get a goop that’s thick enough to form a ribbon when dropped from a spoon.
5. Pack the goop in a tightly sealed container, and use it straight from the jar to glaze cooked fish, seafood or vegetables. The syrup can be used in marinades, rubs or even cocktails.
6. Make the vinaigrette: Whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl or shake in a jar. The goop, syrup and vinaigrette will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator.
