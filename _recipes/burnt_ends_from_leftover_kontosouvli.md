### Ingredients

* `2 lbs` leftover pork kontosouvli
* Greek coffee
* Sea salt and black pepper

#### BBQ Sauce

* `2 cups` ketchup
* `1/2 cup` brown sugar
* `1/2 cup` red wine vinegar
* `1/2 cup` petimezi or honey
* `1 tbsp` smoked paprika (or 2-3 dashes of liquid smoke)
* `1 tsp` garlic powder
* `1 tsp` onion powder
* `2 tsp` black pepper
* Shot of Maple Whiskey
* Hot sauce to taste
* Salt to taste

### Directions

1. Pre-heat your oven to 325F. Season your pork with salt and pepper and sprinkle all sides with Greek coffee and place your pork chunks in foil and place a pyrex or similar oven safe vessel. Place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, make the sauce by adding all the ingredients into a sauce pan and turn heat to medium. Stir to incorporate and once it begins to bubble, taste and adjust flavour with any of the sauce ingredients. Take turn of the heat and reserve.
3. Take the pork out of the oven and test doneness with a fork (if not fork tender, place back in the oven and check in 15 minute intervals).
4. Discard the foil, cut the pork into 1 1/2 pieces, add enough BBQ sauce to coat the meat and place back in the baking vessel and into the oven for another 30-45 minutes or until sauce has darkened, thick and sticky.
5. Transfer to a platter and serve.
