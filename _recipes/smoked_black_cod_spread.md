description: A fish spread featuring two great tastes from the Pacific. The macadamias offer a nice crunch, but the flavor is subtle and does not overpower the cod.

A variation on the [Drop Dead Trout Spread](drop_dead_trout_spread.html). Black Cod (also known as Sablefish) is both tasty and a sustainable choice.

### Ingredients

* `12 oz` smoked black cod (can be made using recipe from [Hot Smoked Salmon](hot_smoked_salmon.html))
* `8 oz` cream cheese, room temperature
* `2 tbsp` minced shallot
* `2 tbsp` chopped parsley
* `1 tbsp` fresh lemon juice
* `1 tbsp` Worstershire Sauce
* `1/4 cup` chopped roasted macadamia nuts
* `Salt`, to taste

### Directions

1. Flake the fish, discarding skin and bones.
2. Place the fish and all remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Whip using a handheld mixer until fluffy. Adjust seasoning. Pack into a small serving bowl and refrigerate, covered, at least 30 minutes before serving.
