---

This lemon meringue ice cream recipe is a delightful twist on the classic lemon meringue pie. It's a perfect treat for those hot summer days when you need something refreshing and tangy.

### Ingredients

* `1` lemon
* `1 cup` sugar
* `1 cup` water
* `6` large egg yolks
* `1 1/2 cups` heavy cream
* `2` large egg whites
* `1/4 teaspoon` cream of tartar

### Directions

1. Grate 1 teaspoon zest from lemon and squeeze 1/4 cup juice.
2. In a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan bring zest, 1/2 cup sugar, and water to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved.
3. In a bowl beat together yolks and remaining 1/2 cup sugar until thick and pale and beat in lemon juice.
4. Add yolk mixture to sugar syrup in a stream, whisking, and simmer, whisking constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 170°F.
5. Pour custard through a sieve into a metal bowl set in a larger bowl of ice and cold water and stir until cold.
6. Beat cream in a chilled bowl with chilled beaters until it just holds stiff peaks and fold into custard.
7. In another bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites with cream of tartar and a pinch salt until they just hold soft peaks.
8. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating, and beat until whites just hold stiff peaks.
9. Fold meringue into custard gently but thoroughly and freeze in an ice-cream maker.
10. Transfer ice cream to an airtight container and put in freezer to harden.

### Notes

- Make sure to chill the bowl and beaters before beating the cream for the best results.
