title: Sourdough Potato Bread
---

This bread has a creamy white moist interior and excellent taste and texture and is a high riser. This recipe is a favorite among sourdough bread lovers. The secret to its fluffiness is the use of mashed potatoes, which gives it a unique texture and flavor. The bread requires patience due to its long rising times, but the result is well worth the wait.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` sourdough starter- left out at room temp and bubbly
* `1 1/2 cups` warm water
* `2 cups` bread flour
* `1 cup` plain prepared mashed potatoes
* `3/4 cup` warm water
* `2 teaspoons` salt (could use a little more)
* `1/3 cup` oil or melted margarine or butter
* `1/3 cup` sugar
* `6 1/2 to 7 cups` bread flour

### Directions

1. Combine the active starter with 1 1/2 cups water, 2 cups flour and the mashed potatoes.
2. Beat well, cover and let this "sponge" stay in a warm place until very light and bubbly. This will take several hours in warm surroundings or overnight in cooler surroundings.
3. Stir down the mixture and add the 3/4 cup warm water, salt, oil, sugar and half the remaining flour.
4. Beat well by hand with a wooden mixing spoon. Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a medium firm dough.
5. Knead the dough well, only adding additional flour to prevent the dough from sticking.
6. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in a warm place. This will take quite some hours.
7. When doubled, lightly punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions.
8. Shape the dough and place into oiled bread pans. Cover and let the dough rise in the pans until doubled or well above the rim of the pans. This will take hours.
9. Bake in a 375 F degree oven until golden and tested done about 45 minutes or more.
10. When done carefully remove form the pans and let cool completely on a cooling rack.
11. Bread freezes well.

### Notes

- Rising times are long and are not included in the prep time. Patience is key in this recipe.
