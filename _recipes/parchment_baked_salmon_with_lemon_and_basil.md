title: Parchment Baked Salmon with Lemon and Basil
---
This recipe is a simple and healthy way to prepare salmon. The salmon is baked in parchment, which locks in all the juices and flavors. The addition of lemon and basil gives the salmon a fresh and tangy taste.

### Ingredients

* `6` 6-ounce salmon fillets
* Salt and pepper to taste
* `6` 15-square inch pieces parchment paper
* `1/4 cup` chopped basil leaves
* `2 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil
* `2` lemons, thinly sliced
* Kitchen twine

### Directions

1. Place a large baking sheet on bottom rack of oven. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. Season salmon with salt and pepper. Cut two half inch slices into flesh of each piece of salmon; roll basil leaves and stuff into slits in salmon.
3. Place a salmon fillet in the center of each piece of parchment paper. Drizzle each fillet with 1 teaspoon of the oil, then place lemon slices on top. Gather sides of parchment up over salmon to form a pouch, leaving no openings, and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Place packages directly on hot baking sheet in oven and cook for 13 min (thin) - 15 minutes (thicker). Transfer to plates and carefully open packages to release steam before serving.
