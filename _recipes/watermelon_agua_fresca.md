This cooling drink is a perfect antidote to hot summer days.

### Ingredients

* `1` 10lb watermelon
* `1/2 cup` sugar, or to taste
* `1` juice of lime, or to taste
* `to taste` water

### Directions

1. Cut the watermelon into quarters, and scoop out the flesh with a spoon, leaving the rind behind. Puree in batches in a food processor or blender, enough to liquefy but still leaving seeds largely intact. If watermelon is dry, add water as necessary to ensure smooth blending. Remove seeds from resulting liquid with a colander or large sieve. Add sugar and lime juice to taste. If resulting liquid is still a bit thick, add water as necessary.
2. Chill, and serve with ice.
