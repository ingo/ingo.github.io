title: Feta Brulee With Honey and Sesame Seeds
---
This recipe is a standout from the dishes served at some of the Greek Supper Clubs. The twist here is that a kitchen torch is used to brulee the top of the Feta cheese, giving it a stunning look and a slight charred taste. Feta has been paired with honey for ages and sesame seeds are often in the mix. Lemon verbena is used in the photo but mint works just fine here.

### Ingredients

* `1` piece of firm Feta (about `Â½` inch thick)
* `1 tsp` of granulated sugar
* `2-3 tbsp` Greek honey
* Sesame seeds
* Dried or chopped mint
* Honey comb for garnish

### Directions

1. Take your Feta out of the brine, carefully pat-dry to remove any moisture and allow to about 10 minutes to come to room temperature.
2. Place the cheese on a heat-resistant plate and sprinkle the top with sugar. Take your kitchen torch and pass the flame over the top until the cheese has charred to your liking.
3. Wait a couple of minutes, transfer to a plate then drizzle with honey, sprinkle with sesame seeds and garnish with a piece of honeycomb and mint.
4. Serve as a meze with Ouzo or Tsipouro.
