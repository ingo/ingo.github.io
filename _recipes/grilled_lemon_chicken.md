This recipe, perfect for a casual outdoor gathering, focuses on the simple yet flavorful combination of chicken parts, herbs, and lemon. Originally designed for dark meat parts, it can be adapted for other cuts or even a whole chicken. The optional brining step enhances the juiciness and flavor of the chicken, while the two-level grilling method ensures a perfect balance of sear and slow cook. Alternatively, an oven-roasting option is provided for those who prefer indoor cooking.

### Ingredients
* `8` chicken thighs or `4` whole legs
* `¾ cup` kosher salt or `6 tbsp` table salt (for brining)
* `2 tbsp` olive oil    
* `2` large garlic cloves, minced very fine
* `½ cup` fresh lemon juice
* Freshly ground black pepper
* `1½ tsp` minced fresh oregano or thyme leaves

### Directions
1. Trim all overhanging fat from the chicken pieces. For optional brining, dissolve the salt in `1 quart` water in a gallon-size sealable plastic bag. Add the chicken, press out excess air, seal, and refrigerate for about `1½ hours`.

2. For the lemon sauce, place the olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat. When the garlic just begins to sizzle, remove from heat. Mix with the lemon juice in a large, shallow nonreactive pan. Set aside.

3. If grilling, prepare the grill with `5 quarts` of charcoal. Build a two-level fire with one side for medium-hot heat and one side for medium-low heat. Cover and heat the grill rack for `5 minutes`. If oven-roasting, preheat the oven to `425°F (220°C)`.

4. Remove chicken from the brine, rinse, and dry thoroughly. Season with pepper. If not brined, season generously with salt and pepper. If oven-roasting, lift the chicken thighs from the lemon sauce, letting any excess drip back into the bowl. Place the chicken on a rimmed sheet pan and let sit at room temperature while the oven heats.

5. If grilling, grill uncovered over medium-hot heat, extinguishing flare-ups if needed, until seared, `1–2 minutes per side`. Move to medium-low heat and continue grilling uncovered, turning occasionally, for `12–16 minutes` for thighs or `16–20 minutes` for whole legs. Chicken is done when the internal temperature reaches `165°F`. If oven-roasting, bake until fully cooked and lightly browned, `25–30 minutes`. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should register `165–175°F`.

6. Stir the oregano into the lemon sauce. Roll the chicken in the sauce to coat. If grilling, return to the coolest part of the grill and cook over low heat `5 minutes longer`, turning and brushing once or twice. If oven-roasting, return the chicken to the lemon sauce, turning to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature.

### Notes
* Brining is optional but recommended for enhanced flavor and juiciness.
* Flare-ups usually occur during the first few minutes on the grill; if charring begins, move the chicken to a cooler zone.
* The recipe can be adapted for chicken breasts or a whole chicken by adjusting cooking times accordingly.
