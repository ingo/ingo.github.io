This recipe is part of a year-long collective effort of a group of bloggers participating in "CharcutePalooza," using ancient methods of preserving meats. The first challenge was to create duck breast prosciutto, guided by Michael Ruhlmanâ€™s book on charcuterie.

### Ingredients

* `2` boneless, skin-on duck breasts
* `Lots` of kosher salt
* `White pepper` to taste
* `Kitchen twine` for trussing
* `Cheesecloth` for wrapping

### Directions

1. Score the skin side of the duck breasts with a sharp knife to allow the salt to penetrate better.
2. Add a layer of kosher salt to a flat, nonreactive dish. A half an inch or so should be fine.
3. Place both duck breasts on the salt, ensuring they are not touching each other.
4. Add another layer of salt over top of the duck breasts, so that they are completely covered.
5. Cover the pan in plastic wrap and place in a refrigerator for 24 hours.
6. After a day packed in salt, remove the duck breasts, rinse them well under cold water, and pat them dry with paper towels.
7. Wrap the duck breasts in cheese cloth and hang them for a week to cure in a fairly humid environment, with an ideal temperature between 50 and 60 degrees.
8. The duck prosciutto is finished curing when it has lost approximately 30% of its weight.

### Notes

This recipe is a part of a culinary adventure, exploring ancient methods of preserving meats. The duck prosciutto can be served as a mid-afternoon snack with some aged manchego cheese, green olives and crackers, or used in other recipes. The remaining prosciutto can be frozen for future use.
