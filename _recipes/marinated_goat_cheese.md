### Ingredients

* `12` large fresh thyme sprigs
* `12` large fresh rosemary sprigs
* `1 tsp` crumbled dried lavender
* `1` soft mild cheve log (about 11 ounces), without ash, cut crosswise into 8 rounds
* `1 Â½ cups` extra virgin olive oil
* Coarsely ground black pepper, to taste
* `16` fresh ripe figs, halved (optional)

### Directions

1. Arrange half the thyme, rosemary, and lavender in the bottom of a shallow nonreactive dish just large enough to hold the chevres in a single layer. 
2. Place the 8 chevres on top and cover with the remaining herbs. 
3. Drizzle the oil over the cheese and herbs so it covers them completely. 
4. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. 
5. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours. 
6. Serve, or store covered in the refrigerator and let warm to room temperature before serving. 
7. Before serving, arrange the figs decoratively around the cheese.
