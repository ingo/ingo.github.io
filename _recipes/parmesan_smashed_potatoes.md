They're a delicious side dish option that requires only a few ingredients to prepare. Whether I make them in hash brown muffins with eggs for breakfast, or topped with spicy beef turning them into taco taters as an appetizer or a loaded potato casserole, they're the first dish to go.

### Ingredients

* `2 lb` small or medium red or golden potatoes  (around 12 total)
* `2 tbsp` olive oil divided
* `2 tbsp` unsalted butter melted
* `2 tbsp` grated Parmesan cheese
* `1 tsp` granulated garlic or garlic powder
* `½ tsp` salt
* `½ tsp` onion powder
* `½ tsp` black pepper
* `1 tbsp` chopped parsley

### Directions

1. Steam, microwave or boil potatoes just until fork tender. Drain, set aside to cool. 
2. To prepare: Preheat oven to 425°F. Brush a rimmed sheet pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil. 
3. In a small bowl, mix together Parmesan, garlic, salt, onion powder and pepper. 
4. Arrange potatoes on baking sheet. Use a potato masher or fork to smash to about ½ inch thickness. Mix together remaining olive oil and butter. Brush over potatoes.
5. Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan-seasoning blend. 
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes until edges are golden. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. 

### Notes

* You can use a combination of small red potatoes and golden potatoes for visual appeal.
* You can use fresh or canned grated Parmesan cheese for this recipe.
* The cooler the potato, the better it holds together when smashing. Allow the potatoes to cool for at least 10 minutes or up to 30 minutes for the best results.
* You can make this recipe using smaller or larger potatoes. The smaller potatoes become even more crispy when baking.
* Do not replace the dried garlic with fresh. Fresh garlic is more apt to burn.
* The amount of potatoes can be increased, or decreased to suit your needs.
* Serve these potatoes just as they are or with sour cream on the side.
* You can also make smashed potatoes on the grill.
* Store leftover Parmesan Smashed Potatoes chilled in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat in a skillet, an air fryer or on a sheet pan in a 375°F oven.
