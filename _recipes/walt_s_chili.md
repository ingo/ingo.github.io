This hearty chili recipe is based on Walt’s own recipe, and is delicious topped with sour cream, cheese, and fresh tomatoes. Walt’s diet was that of a mid-western meat and potatoes man: his taste was simple but hardy. Throughout most of his life funding was always an issue but he was always able to find a way to make ends meet. One of his fixes was his favorite chili.

Walt usually combined a can of Gebhardt’s (which had a lot of meat, few beans) and Dennison’s (lots of beans, not a lot of meat) when he ate at the Studio. The chili was always joined with a glass of V-8 and saltine crackers. This combination pleased his taste buds and his wallet.

Later once the Studio was financially sound, he also enjoyed the chili at Chasen’s, a popular Hollywood restaurant at the time. When Walt traveled, he would bring cans of chili and beans with him. One time when he was dining at the Dorchester Hotel in London, he had the waiter serve him the canned chili and crackers he brought with him, which embarrassed Lilly and Harry Tytle, one of the Studio producers, who were dining with him.

In his home later in his life, the family cook was able to perfect the recipe, (a nice balance between meat and beans). The result is the recipe used in the Parks today! The recipe was obtained from Walt’s oldest daughter, Diane, and the Family Museum in San Francisco, and is currently offered at Carnation Café at Disneyland Park.
