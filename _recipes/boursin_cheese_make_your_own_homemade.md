description: This easy homemade Boursin cheese recipe recreates the popular French
  garlic and herb cheese. Combining cream cheese, butter, garlic, and herbs makes
  a spreadable cheese that can also be shaped into a log. Making it yourself is economical
  and fun. You can really taste the fresh garlic and herbs versus the store-bought
  version. Adjust the flavorings to your taste - try other herbs like chives or basil.
  Use as a spread or to stuff mushrooms.
