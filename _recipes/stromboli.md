Stromboli, an Italian-American dish that originated in the city of Philadelphia, is like a rolled-up version of pizza. Filled with cheese and Italian deli meats, like pepperoni, salami, and ham, and served with marinara sauce for dipping, it’s a huge crowd-pleaser – perfect for game day, an easy dinner, or anytime you’re having people over. Just keep in mind that stromboli disappears quickly; I recommend making two rolls, especially if you’re feeding men and boys.

### Ingredients

* `1 lb` [homemade](https://www.onceuponachef.com/how-to/pizza-dough-recipe.html) or store-bought pizza dough
* `1 tsp` extra-virgin olive oil
* `1` clove garlic, minced
* `¼ tsp` dried oregano
* A few pinches crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
* `3 tbsp` finely grated pecorino romano
* `4 thin slices (3 oz)` provolone cheese
* `4 medium slices (3 oz)` deli ham
* `4 thin slices (3 oz)` mozzarella cheese
* `14 thin, large slices (3 oz)` Italian cured meats, such as salami, pepperoni, bresaola, etc. (use at least two different kinds for best results)
* `1` egg, beaten
* Store-bought or [homemade marinara sauce](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/tomato-sauce-basil.html), for serving (optional)

### Directions

1. Line a 13x18-inch baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. On a lightly floured work surface, stretch and/or roll the dough into a 10x12-inch rectangle, about ¼-inch thick. (Be sure not to roll the dough too thin.)
3. Arrange the dough rectangle so the long side is closest to you. Brush the surface with the oil, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Spread the garlic evenly over the top of the oil, then sprinkle with the oregano, a pinch of red pepper flakes (if using), and the pecorino romano.
4. Shingle the provolone slices evenly over the pecorino romano, followed by the ham, mozzarella, and cured meats. Brush the borders of the dough with the egg (reserve the remaining egg for brushing the top of the stromboli). Fold the bottom third of the stromboli in toward the middle. Fold the top third of stromboli down to cover first fold, creating a wide log, like a folded letter. Pinch the seam tightly to seal. Transfer the stromboli to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Pinch the ends tightly to seal and tuck underneath the stromboli. Loosely cover the stromboli with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour. (The stromboli won't look much different after the rise; that's okay.)
5. Preheat the oven to 375°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.
6. Brush the top of the dough with the remaining egg. Using a sharp knife, make 5 evenly spaced ½-inch-deep slits, 1½ inches long, on top of the stromboli. Bake until golden brown, puffy, and bubbling, about 35 minutes (if you have a thermometer, the center should register 200°F). Some grease or cheese may bubble out of the sides and top; that's normal. Use a paper towel to blot any excess grease on the baking sheet. Let the stromboli cool on the baking sheet for 15 to 20 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1-inch-thick slices. Serve warm or at room temperature, with marinara sauce on the side (if using).

### Notes

- The stromboli can be prepared, covered with plastic wrap, and refrigerated for up to 12 hours before baking. Add the egg wash and cut slits right before baking, and allow a few extra minutes in the oven. To freeze the stromboli before baking, fill and roll the stromboli as directed but do not add the egg wash or cut slits. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Add the egg wash and cut slits right before baking, and allow a few extra minutes in the oven.
