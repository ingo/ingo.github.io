title: Spicy Cumin Lamb Dumplings with Fly by Jing Chili Oil
---
Inspired by Xian Famous Foods’ spicy cumin lamb noodles, these juicy dumplings are bursting with rich flavors thanks to Fly by Jing’s Sichuan chili crisp oil and sauces.

### Ingredients

* For the dumpling filling:
  * `1.5 cups` shredded zucchini (1 small zucchini or 1/2 large zucchini)
  * `1 lb.` ground lamb (80% lean/20% fat ratio)
  * `1.5 tbsp` light soy sauce
  * `1.5 tbsp` dark soy sauce
  * `1.5 tbsp` shaoxing wine
  * `1 tbsp` sesame oil
  * `1 tbsp` Fly by Jing mala spice mix
  * `1 tbsp` ground cumin
  * `2 tsp` ground white pepper
  * `5 cloves` fresh garlic, minced
  * `1.5 inch` knob ginger, minced
  * `1/2 cup` chopped cilantro (1 small bunch)
  * `1 cup` chopped scallions (1 bunch)
  * `1` egg
* For the dumplings:
  * `40-50` round dumpling wrappers
  * `3 tbsp.` oil, like canola or peanut
  * `1/4 cup` water

### Directions

1. If using frozen dumpling wrappers, set them aside to thaw on your kitchen counter while you prepare the rest of your ingredients.
2. Shred the zucchini with a cheese grater and toss in a bowl with a pinch of salt. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then use a clean towel or cheese cloth to wring out the excess moisture.
3. Use your hands to combine the zucchini with all the remaining dumpling filling ingredients in a large bowl so all the seasonings are fully and evenly incorporated.
4. Prepare to fold your dumplings: get a small bowl filled with water and wet some paper towels or a clean kitchen towel big enough to fit over a metal tray or plates to place your finished dumplings on – this will keep your dumplings and dumpling wrappers from drying out.
5. To fold your dumplings, wet the edges of a dumpling wrapper with water – this will turn the flour coating your wrappers into glue!
6. Use chopsticks or a spoon to place a tablespoon of filling in the center of the dumpling wrapper.
7. Fold the wrapper in half like a taco, pinching together the center where the two ends of the wrapper meet. Then use your thumbs or index fingers to pull the right side of the wrapper toward the center to form a small pleat, repeating down the edge of the wrapper so you have 3 pleats on the right side. Now repeat on the left side, pulling the wrapper toward the center in the opposite direction, forming 3 pleats on that side. Press the edges, using a dab of water if necessary to seal the edges. Place your completed dumpling under the damp kitchen towel or paper towels and continue folding dumplings until you use all of the filling.
8. I recommend pan frying the dumplings for the best flavor and texture, but you can also boil them by cooking them in a pot of boiling water for 8-10 minutes, or steam them in your rice cooker or with a bamboo steamer for 10-15 minutes until the wrappers are fully cooked.
9. To pan fry the dumplings, heat 3 tbsp. oil over medium high heat in a skillet. Once the oil is shimmering, place the dumplings in the oil – I like to press the bottoms into the oil and then arrange them into a ring in the pan. Let them fry in the oil for 2-3 minutes, then add 1/4 cup of water and quickly cover the pan with a lid – this will steam the tops of the dumplings.
10. Cook the dumplings covered for another 4-6 minutes until the water has evaporated and the dumpling skins are translucent and cooked through. Remove the lid and pan fry for another minute to really crisp up the bottom if needed, then transfer your cooked dumplings to a serving plate.
11. Top the dumplings with Fly by Jing’s Sichuan chili crisp oil, Zhong dumpling sauce, chinkiang vinegar, fried garlic, chopped scallions, and fresh cilantro as desired and enjoy!

### Notes

- Get 15% off your Fly by Jing order with my code INDULGENTEATS. I highly recommend using their sauces and spice mixes to save yourself time and so you don’t sacrifice on flavor, but if you are not in their delivery range you can try the following substitutions:

* Instead of mala spice mix, try mixing ground numbing Sichuan peppercorns, ground spicy Sichuan chili powder, and mushroom powder
* Instead of the Sichuan chili crisp oil, try using another chili crisp oil like Lao Gan Ma
* Instead of the Zhong dumpling sauce, try using soy sauce mixed sesame oil, minced garlic and a bit of brown sugar (though again, this is missing so many of the spices and ingredients that make the dumpling sauce amazing!)
