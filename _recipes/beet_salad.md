title: Beet Salad
---

Beets are roasted until caramelized, intensifying their natural sweet,
  earthy flavor. Served over fresh greens with a tangy shallot vinaigrette and toasted
  walnuts. This salad really lets the flavors of beets
  shine.

### Ingredients

* `2 pounds` golden beets (5-6 medium)
* `¼ cup` extra-virgin olive oil (some bacon grease works well too)
* `2 tablespoons` sherry vinegar, or white-wine vinegar
* `½ teaspoon` Dijon mustard
* `½ teaspoon` honey
* `½ teaspoon` salt
* Freshly ground pepper, to taste
* `1` large shallot, finely chopped
* `1/4 cup` crushed walnuts
* Little chopped parsley
* Crumbled goat cheese

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Divide beets between 2 pieces of foil; bring edges together and crimp to make packets. Roast until the beets are just tender when pierced with the point of a knife, about 1¼ hours. Unwrap the beets and let cool.
2. Meanwhile, whisk oil, vinegar, mustard, honey, salt and pepper in a small bowl to make dressing.
3. When the beets are cool enough to handle, slip off the skins. Cut into ½-inch cubes and place in a large bowl. Add celery, shallot and the dressing; toss to coat well. Serve at room temperature or chilled.
