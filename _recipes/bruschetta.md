The crisp, garlicky toast is a perfect canvas for showcasing bruschetta toppings. Serve these toasts warm right after baking and they will be crispy outside and slightly soft inside.

### Ingredients

* `1` round loaf country bread, not too dense, 8 to 10 inches in diameter
* `2` garlic cloves, smashed
* `1/4 cup` olive oil
* Salt to taste

### Directions

1. Cut the middle portion of the round loaf into 6 long slices, each about 3/4-inch thick. Cut these slices in half, making 12 half slices that are roughly 3 by 4 inches.
2. When the fire is ready, place the 12 slices over it in a single layer. Cook, turning once, until the outsides of the bread are golden brown with grill marks. This should take about 2 minutes per side; check frequently to make sure the bread isn't burning.
3. When the bread slices are done, rub each one with smashed garlic cloves (lightly or heavily, depending on your garlic preference). Place the slices on a large platter in a single layer.
4. Sprinkle each slice with 2 teaspoons olive oil, breaking the surface of the bread slightly with a spoon to let the oil soak in. Season with salt. Turn the slices over and repeat the oil and salt procedure.
5. Let the slices sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve as is for simple bruschetta.
