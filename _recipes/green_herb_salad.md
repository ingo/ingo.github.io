This salad is a delightful mix of fresh herbs and greens, tossed with a simple yet flavorful dressing. The combination of different herbs gives it a unique and refreshing taste, while the toasted seeds add a nice crunch.

### Ingredients

* `40g` coriander leaves, picked
* `20g` basil leaves, torn
* `40g` parsley leaves, very roughly chopped
* `15g` picked dill
* `20g` mint leaves, torn
* `35g` purslane or lambs lettuce, torn
* `60g` rocket, torn
* `100g` mange tout, finely sliced
* `30g` flaked almonds, lightly toasted with `½ tbsp` olive oil
* `30g` toasted pumpkin seeds
* `½ tsp` nigella seeds
* `15g` toasted sesame seeds
* `½ tsp` chilli flakes
* For the Dressing:
* `45ml` olive oil
* `6` sage leaves
* `2 tbsp` lemon juice
* Salt and black pepper

### Directions

1. Start with the dressing. Place the olive oil and sage in a small pan and put on medium heat. Remove as soon as the sage begins to sizzle and leave aside to cool. Remove the sage leaves, transfer the oil to a bowl and whisk the infused oil together with the lemon juice, `¼ teaspoon` of salt and `¼ teaspoon` of black pepper.
2. Place all of the herbs, leaves and mange tout in a large bowl. Scatter over the seed mix by hand. Just before serving, pour over the dressing. Lightly toss everything together and serve immediately.
