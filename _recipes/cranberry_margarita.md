description: Fantastic margarita recipe. This margarita recipe strikes the perfect
  balance of sweet and tart thanks to the addition of cranberry juice. The cranberry
  provides a subtle fruity twist on a classic cocktail that keeps you coming back
  for more. Tequila, orange liqueur and lime mingle with the cranberry juice for a
  drink as beautifully balanced as it is tempting.
