This recipe for Pico de Gallo, a classic Mexican condiment, comes from J. Kenji López-Alt, a chef well-known for his love of flavorful and authentic cuisine. This dish is a staple in Mexican cuisine, and its name literally translates to "rooster's beak". The name is said to come from the finger motion used when picking up bits of the salsa to stuff into tacos or top totopos. This version of the recipe is optimized for better flavor and texture, using the best, most flavorful tomatoes available and a special salting technique to enhance the tomatoes' flavor.

### Ingredients

* `1 1/2 pounds (680g)` ripe tomatoes, cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch dice
* Kosher salt
* `1/2` large white onion, finely diced
* `1 to 2` serrano or jalapeño chiles, finely diced (seeds and membranes removed for a milder salsa)
* `1/2 cup` finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
* `1 tablespoon (15ml)` lime juice from 1 lime

### Directions

1. Season tomatoes with 1 teaspoon (4g) salt and toss to combine. Transfer to a fine-mesh strainer or colander set in a bowl and allow to drain for 20 to 30 minutes. Discard liquid.
2. Combine drained tomatoes with onion, chiles, cilantro, and lime juice. Toss to combine and season to taste with salt. Pico de gallo can be stored for up to 3 days in a sealed container in the refrigerator.

### Notes

- Use the ripest tomatoes you can find. In the off season, this generally means smaller plum, Roma, or cherry tomatoes. Pico de gallo keeps for up to three days in the refrigerator in an tightly sealed container.
