description: This guide covers key brining techniques for various meats like pork
  chops, chicken, and turkey to help retain moisture and impart flavor. It includes
  details on wet brines, buttermilk brines, and dry rubs along with tips for brining
  success. Brining pork or poultry before cooking enhances juiciness and infuses seasoning
  all the way through. A wet brine of salt, sugar and aromatics adds the most moisture

### Notes

- This guide provides different ratios of salt, sugar, and water for brining.

* `3:3:100` (3% brine): `30 g` salt per L water for a 3% solution
* `5:0:100` (5% brine): `50 g` salt per L water for a 5% solution

### Directions

1. For salmon and overnight chicken brining, use the 3% brine solution.
2. For other meats, use the 5% brine solution. The brining time varies depending on the type of meat:
    * Cornish Game Hens: `2 hours`
    * Whole Chicken: `5 hours`
3. After brining, dry the meat on a rack for the same amount of time to equalize the salt gradient.

### Notes

- Brining time is approximately `1 hour` per pound of meat. Adjust accordingly for larger or smaller cuts.
