### Notes

- This guide provides different ratios of salt, sugar, and water for brining.

* `3:3:100` (3% brine): `30 g` salt per L water for a 3% solution
* `5:0:100` (5% brine): `50 g` salt per L water for a 5% solution

### Directions

1. For salmon and overnight chicken brining, use the 3% brine solution.
2. For other meats, use the 5% brine solution. The brining time varies depending on the type of meat:
    * Cornish Game Hens: `2 hours`
    * Whole Chicken: `5 hours`
3. After brining, dry the meat on a rack for the same amount of time to equalize the salt gradient.

### Notes

- Brining time is approximately `1 hour` per pound of meat. Adjust accordingly for larger or smaller cuts.
