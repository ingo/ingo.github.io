### Ingredients

#### Pre-fermented Dough

* `125g` Strong White Flour
* `3.5g` Salt
* `45g` Water
* `1/4 tsp` instant yeast
* `200g` starter

#### Main Dough

* `205g` Strong White Flour
* `5g` Salt
* `245ml` Water
* `2.5g` instant yeast
* Pre-fermented dough

### Directions

#### Day 1

1. Combine the flour and salt together in a clean bowl.
2. Crumble the fresh yeast into the water and stir together to help the yeast dissolve.
3. Pour the yeasted water into the flour.
4. Combine all the ingredients to form a rough dough.
5. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 3 to 4 minutes.
6. Place the dough into an oiled bowl. Cover with cling film and place into the fridge for 12-24 hours.

#### Day 2

1. The next morning, remove the pre-fermented dough from the fridge.
2. In a large clean bowl combine the strong white flour and salt.
3. Crumble the fresh yeast into the water and stir together to help the yeast dissolve.
4. Pour the yeasted water into the flour.
5. Break the pre-fermented dough into smaller pieces and add it to the flour and water mix.
6. Start working all the ingredients together to form a rough dough.
7. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead the dough until the window pane affect has been achieved. This may take 8 – 10 minutes.
8. Once the window pane affect has been achieved place the dough into a large clean bowl that has been oiled. Cover with cling film and place the dough into the fridge for 18-24 hours.

#### Day 3

1. Remove the dough from the fridge and turn out onto a clean work surface then knock back.
2. Divide the dough into even portions approximately 250g each.
3. Shape each portion of dough into a ball and allow the dough to rest on the work surface for 5 minutes.
4. Working with one portion of dough at a time begin to form a baguette. Flatten out the dough evenly into a rough rectangle.
5. Taking the edge closest to you, fold the dough over about an inch then crimp the edges together as you roll. 
6. Fold the dough over again, and again, crimping the seams together.
7. Repeat one more time so that the dough resembles a sausage about 15cm in length.
8. Place the dough to one side leaving it to rest while you start to shape the next portion of dough. By the time each portion of dough has been pre-shaped, the first portion of dough is ready to undergo its final shaping.
9. Using the palms of your hands, start in the middle and roll the dough out, moving from the middle to outside as you roll. Roll the dough out to about 30 – 35cm in length. 
10. Arrange the baguettes seamed side up and side by side using the tea towel as a barrier between each. Leave the baguettes to prove for about 50 to 60 minutes.
11. Preheat the oven to 240°C fan assisted or its highest setting if your oven does not go that high. Place a baking tray into the base of the oven. 
12. Gently roll each baguette out of the tea towel and lift on to a baking tray, placing the baguettes seam side down.
13. Score the baguette with 4 lines at a very slight diagonal along the length of the dough, the scores should overlap slightly.
14. Place the baguettes into the preheated oven and pour boiling water in the baking tray in the base of the oven to create a burst of steam. Bake for 20-25 minutes. 

### Notes

The dough can be held in a fridge for up to 36 hours. If you do not wish to bake all the dough at once, simply take what you need, shape it and bake it, leaving the remainder of the dough in the fridge which you can return to at any time within that 36-hour time period. This will allow you to bake fresh baguettes day after day. The dough from the fridge, once shaped, will be ready to bake in less than 2 hours.
