Perfect for using up those overripe bananas. This Double Chocolate Banana Bread recipe is a delicious twist on the classic banana bread. It incorporates rich cocoa powder and chocolate chunks for a double dose of chocolate. This recipe is perfect for using up those overripe bananas that are just a day away from attracting fruit flies. It's a simple one-bowl recipe that requires no special equipment and can be made with ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen.

### Ingredients

* `3` very ripe medium-to-large bananas
* `½ cup` (115 grams) butter, melted
* `¾ cup` (145 grams) brown sugar (either light or dark works)
* `1` large egg
* `1 tsp` pure vanilla extract
* `1 tsp` baking soda
* `¼ tsp` table salt
* `½ tsp` ground cinnamon (optional)
* `1 cup` (125 grams) all-purpose flour
* `½ cup` Dutch-process cocoa powder
* `1 cup` (about 6 ounces or 170 grams) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chunks or chips

### Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Butter a 9×5-inch loaf pan, or spray it with a nonstick baking spray.
2. Mash bananas in the bottom of a large bowl. (You’ll have a little over 1 cup mashed banana total.)
3. Whisk in melted butter, then brown sugar, egg, and vanilla.
4. Place baking soda, salt, cinnamon (if using), flour and cocoa powder in a sifter or fine-mesh strainer and sift over wet ingredients. (This is essential if your cocoa is lumpy.)
5. Stir dry and wet ingredients with a spoon until just combined. Stir in chocolate chunks or chips.
6. Pour into prepared pan and bake for 55 to 65 minutes, until a tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free. (A melted chocolate chip smear is expected, however.)
7. Cool in pan for 10 to 15 minutes, then run a knife around the edge and invert it out onto a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

### Notes

- The banana bread will keep for up to 4 days at room temperature if wrapped in foil.
