description: This refreshing salad combines avocado, grapefruit segments, shaved fennel,
  arugula, and Parmesan cheese with a light olive oil and lemon dressing. It showcases
  the dynamic flavor contrasts of sweet, tart and bitter. The juicy grapefruit, aromatic
  fennel and rich avocado complement each other beautifully. A nice change of pace
  from typical green salads.
