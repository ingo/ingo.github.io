### Ingredients

* `3` Eggs, separated
* `6 tbs` granulated sugar
* `3/4 c` cake flour, sifted
* `6 tbs` Confectioner's Sugar

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, then brush 2 baking sheets with softened butter and line with parchment paper. A Silpat works well too.
2. Beat the egg whites with a whisk or electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gradually beat in the granulated sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form again; the meringue will be glossy and smooth. Lightly beat the egg yolks with a fork, and fold into the meringue with a wooden spoon. Sift the flour over the mixture and fold in gently.
3. Pipe the ladyfingers: Fit the pastry bag with the large plain tip and fill with the ladyfinger batter. Pipe strips of batter 5 in. long and 3/4 in. wide diagonally onto the baking sheets, leaving 1 to 2 in. between each strip. Sprinkle half the confectioner's sugar over the ladyfingers; wait 5 minutes and sprinkle with the remaining sugar.
4. Holding the parchment paper in place with your thumb, lift one side of the baking sheet and gently tap it on the work surface to remove excess confectioner's sugar.
5. Bake without opening the oven door for 10 min.
6. Rotate the baking sheet so the ladyfingers color evenly. Cook until lightly golden, about 5 more minutes.
7. Remove the ladyfingers from the baking sheet with a metal spatula while still hot, and let cool on a rack.
