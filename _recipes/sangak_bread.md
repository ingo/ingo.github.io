You may bake the bread without using any stones if you wish, although the special flavor and shape of the bread does come from using stones.

### Ingredients

* `1 tbsp` Dry yeast
* `2 1/2 cups` Warm water
* `3 cups` Whole wheat flour (sifted)
* `1 cup` Strong white flour
* `4 tbsp` Sesame seeds
* `1 1/2 tsp` Salt
* Cooking and peanut oil, as needed
* Baking stone
* Baker's peel

### Directions

1. Mix the yeast and 1/4 cup of warm water in a bowl. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes and then add salt and 1 1/2 cups of warm water. Let this stand for 10 minutes. Slowly add the rest of the warm water, and flour while mixing until it becomes smooth and consistent. 
2. Use a new bowl that has been lined with 2 tablespoons of regular cooking oil. Put the dough in the bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm, dark place overnight. The dough will have a chance to rise in this manner.
3. Warm the baking stone in the lower level of the oven at 500Â° F for approximately 15 minutes. Knead the dough with well-oiled hands for 15 minutes. Use an oiled surface to divide the dough into 6 pieces. Flatten the pieces to be 1/2 an inch thick. 
4. Sprinkle some flour on the baker's peel and place the dough on one end of the peel. Using wet fingers, perforate the top of the loaf and sprinkle it with sesame seeds. You may also use poppy or nigella seeds or a mixture of all three kinds of seeds to taste.
5. Brush the oven rack with some peanut oil. Transfer the loaf onto the hot stone and return the rack to the oven. Bake for 1 minute and then press down the dough with the baker's peel. Bake for an additional 3 minutes, turn over and bake for 2 minutes. 
6. Using the baker's peel, remove the bread from the stone. Cover the bread to keep it warm. Repeat this procedure for all remaining loaves. Sangak bread is best served hot. You may keep the Sangak hot in the oven on a low temperature. You can also use clean towels to wrap before serving, and you may freeze the Sangak bread and reuse when needed.
