title: Lamb Sliders with Peach Chutney
---

The term "slider" originally referred to a specific type of sandwich, namely small hamburgers. The name is said to have originated in the 1940s at White Castle, an American fast-food restaurant chain. White Castle is often credited with popularizing the slider concept. They introduced small, square-shaped hamburgers with a distinctive flavor, and they were designed to be easily consumed in one or two bites. These bite-sized burgers were initially called "slyders," a name that was eventually changed to "sliders."

### Ingredients

* `1 1/2 lbs` ground lamb
* `8` small Hamburger Buns
* `1` cheddar cheese
* `1` minced shallots
* `1` Peach Chutney
* `1` mayonnaise
* `1` salt
* `1` pepper

### Directions

1. Mix the lamb with salt and pepper to taste and form into 8 small patties. 
2. Grill or broil until done on one side, then flip and cover with a slice of cheddar cheese.
3. While the burgers are cooking, cut the buns in half and toast, if desired. 
4. Spread the base with mayonnaise. 
5. Place the finished patty on top, cover with a large dollop of peach chutney and sprinkle with the mined shallots. 
6. Serve immediately.
