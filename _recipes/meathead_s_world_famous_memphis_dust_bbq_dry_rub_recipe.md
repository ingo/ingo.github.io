This flavorful BBQ dry rub recipe is the best and only backyard seasoning you’ll ever need. If you’ve ever enjoyed true Memphis barbecue at world famous joints like Paynes, Cozy Corner, Rendezvous, or the Bar-B-Q Shop then you know that the “go-to” dish is Memphis dry rub ribs. 

### Ingredients

* `¾ cup` firmly packed dark brown sugar
* `¾ cup` white sugar
* `½ cup` American paprika
* `¼ cup` garlic powder
* `2 tbsp` ground black pepper
* `2 tbsp` ground ginger powder
* `2 tbsp` onion powder
* `2 tsp` rosemary powder

### Directions

1. Mix the ingredients thoroughly in a bowl. If the sugar is lumpy, crumble the lumps by hand or on the side of the bowl with a fork. 
2. If you store the rub in a tight jar, you can keep it for months. If it clumps just chop it up, or if you wish, spread it on a baking sheet and put it in a 225°F/107.2°C oven for 15 minutes to drive off moisture. No hotter or the sugar can burn.
3. Since our rub recipes contain no salt, we recommend you sprinkle on 1/2 teaspoon of Morton Coarse Kosher Salt per pound/453.6 grams of meat up to 12 hours in advance. For most meats, dampen the surface of the meat with water and sprinkle enough Meathead's Memphis Dust on to coat, but not so much you can't see the meat below. Apply the rub thick enough to make a crunchy crust. Keep your powder dry as the old expression goes. To prevent cross-contamination, one hand sprinkles on the rub and the other hand does the rubbing. Don't put the hand that is rubbing into the powder or use it to hold the bottle.

### Notes

If you are doing whole hog on a cinderblock pit over direct heat, you don't want to risk the sugar burning, so use the same recipe for Meathead's Memphis Dust but omit the sugars.
