This traditional Turkish dessert is a delightful combination of crunchy pistachios, almonds, and flaky filo pastry, all brought together with a sweet orange syrup. It's the perfect way to end a meal.

### Ingredients

* `1` sugar, water and orange juice mixture
* `1` orange flower water
* `1` pistachio, almonds and cinnamon mixture
* `1` filo sheet
* `1` butter

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Brush a 5cm-deep, 21 x 31cm (base measurement) baking dish with butter to grease. Place the sugar, water and orange juice in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until the sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, without stirring, for 20 minutes or until syrup thickens. Transfer to a heatproof jug. Set aside to cool completely. Stir in the orange flower water.
2. Meanwhile, combine the pistachio, almonds and cinnamon in a bowl. Place the filo on a clean work surface. Cover with a clean tea towel, then a damp tea towel (this will prevent it from drying out). Brush 1 filo sheet with butter and fold in half. Cut into 8 strips crossways. Repeat with another filo sheet and butter.
3. Brush 1 filo sheet with butter and fold in half. Line the base of the dish with the filo, leaving a gap at one end. Repeat with 3 more sheets of filo and butter. Use 4 of the filo strips to fill the gap.
4. Sprinkle one-third of the pistachio mixture evenly over the pastry. Continue layering with the remaining filo, butter and pistachio mixture to make two more layers. Finish with a layer of filo.
5. Use a sharp knife to trim the edges. Score the pastry into 24 squares. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden and crisp. Pour over syrup. Set aside for 2 hours to cool completely. Cut into squares to serve.
