Bert Greene was one of the owners of the Store in Amagansett, a gourmet shop and catering outfit on the eastern end of Long Island, N.Y., that was in the early 1970s a kind of lodestar of casual-elegant cooking and entertaining — expensive and, to those with the money to spend it, worth it. (He was like a cross between Ina Garten and Anna Pump, of Loaves & Fishes in Sagaponack.) This is his recipe for a tart, abrasive and wildly delicious dip to serve, garnished with watercress, with an enormous quantity of iced, slivered vegetables. (It’s also great on fish, sandwiches, or even as a dip for slices of delivery pizza.) —Sam Sifton

### Ingredients

* `1` (2-ounce) can flat anchovy fillets packed in oil
* `½ cup` chopped fresh parsley
* `2 tbsp` red wine vinegar
* `2 tbsp` chopped fresh chives or shallots
* `1 tbsp` drained capers, rinsed
* `1 ½ cups` mayonnaise
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* Chilled sliced vegetables, for serving

### Directions

1. Put the anchovies and anchovy oil, parsley, vinegar, chives or shallots, and capers into a blender or food processor and purée until the mixture has nearly liquefied, about 3 minutes, pulsing and scraping down the sides as needed.
2. Add the mayonnaise and pulse to combine. Season with pepper, then transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
3. Serve as a dip with chilled sliced vegetables.
