Topped with a cheeky maraschino cherry, the cocktail is evocative of a time before drinks had to be balanced or nuanced, a time when a bright red glass of sugary bubbles was the pinnacle of festivity. While a classic Shirley Temple is made with either lemon-lime soda or ginger ale, the “dirty” version is commonly made with the former (Sprite or 7Up).

### Ingredients

* `Ice`
* `2 ounces` vodka
* `1 ounce` grenadine
* `8 ounces` lemon-lime soda (such as Sprite or 7Up)
* `1` maraschino cherry, for garnish

### Directions

1. Fill a highball glass with ice. Add the vodka and grenadine to the glass. Top with soda and garnish with a maraschino cherry.
