title: Dirty Shirley
category: Beverages
description: A vodka-spiked variation on the classic, kid-friendly Shirley Temple, is a syrupy-sweet nostalgia trip for adults. Topped with a cheeky maraschino cherry, the cocktail is evocative of a time before drinks had to be balanced or nuanced, a time when a bright red glass of sugary bubbles was the pinnacle of festivity. While a classic Shirley Temple is made with either lemon-lime soda or ginger ale, the “dirty” version is commonly made with the former (Sprite or 7Up).
