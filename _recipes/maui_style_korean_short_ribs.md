title: Maui-Style Korean Short Ribs
---
This recipe brings together the rich flavors of Korean cuisine with a tropical Maui twist. The marinade, packed with soy sauce, vinegar, and spices, seeps into the short ribs to create a mouthwatering dish that's sure to impress at your next barbecue.

### Ingredients

* `32` Korean Cut Beef Short Ribs (Flanken Cut)
* `3 cups` Dark Soy Sauce
* `2 cups` Water
* `6 cups` Demerara Sugar (Brown Sugar)
* `1/4 cup` Red Cider Vinegar
* `1/2 cup` White Vinegar
* `1 1/2 tbsp` Sesame Oil
* `1 tbsp` Fish Sauce
* `6 oz` Fresh Ginger Root
* `8` Cloves Fresh Garlic

### Directions

1. Place all ingredients, except the ribs, into your food processor and run until the garlic and ginger are both minced to small pieces. You can also use a blender and mix in two or three batches or even mince the garlic and ginger by hand and stir everything in a large bowl.
2. Once all items are mixed together, place ribs in a shallow pan or tub and pour the marinade over them, making sure they are as submerged as possible. You can marinate them for as long as three days, but they are also flavorful within 24 hours.
3. Once the marinade has done its work, barbeque the ribs on a medium hot grill for about four to five minutes per side. Be careful to watch them closely as the sweet marinade can cause them to burn quickly.
4. Serve with a crispy fresh salad, baked potato with all the trimmings, a slice of pineapple for garnish, and a nice glass of Merlot or Pinot Gris.

### Notes

* The marinade can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.
* Be sure to keep a close eye on the ribs while they're on the grill to prevent burning.
* The ribs can also be cooked in the oven at 350°F for 2-3 hours for a fall-off-the-bone tender result.
