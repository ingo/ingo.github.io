This recipe is a gourmet take on the classic filet mignon, using a sous vide for perfect, even cooking. The bacon wrap adds a smoky flavor and the whipped horseradish cream provides a tangy contrast to the rich beef.

### Ingredients

* `1` 6-8 lbs. beef tenderloin, whole, PSMO
* `As needed` about 1 tablespoon per filet transglutaminase
* `As needed` one rasher per filet bacon rashers cut thin, high quality
* `As needed` 1 to 2 small sprigs per fillet fresh thyme, sprigs
* `As needed` about 1 tablespoon per filet vegetable oil

**For the whipped horseradish cream:**

* `1 cup` heavy cream
* `1/4 cup` horseradish, prepared and drained well
* `2 tablespoons` coarse grain mustard
* `1 tablespoon` dijon mustard
* `Salt and freshly ground black pepper` to taste

### Directions

1. Carefully remove the tenderloin from its packaging, drain and dry well.
2. Arrange the tenderloin in front of you with the tail end to your right and the wider, butt end to your left.
3. Follow the steps for removing the chain/side muscle and the silverskin.
4. Portion the tenderloin into the butt, the center-cut, and the tail.
5. For French filet mignon, portion 2-4 relatively equal steaks from the top of the tail portion.
6. For tenderloin filet steaks, portion your desired size steaks from any of the three main portions of cleaned and trimmed tenderloin.
7. Set the SV1 to the desired temperature of your finished tenderloin.
8. On a suitable cutting board or a large sheet of parchment paper placed on your work surface layout a bacon rasher.
9. Completely dust the surface of the bacon with the transglutaminase using a can style shaker or similar.
10. Place the filet mignon on its side on the far end of the dusted rasher.
11. Working from left to right at the top, roll the rasher over the filet towards you until completely wrapped and press firmly to adhere.
12. Gently cupping a wrapped steak smooth out any air bubbles or imperfections gently with the palm of your hand.
13. Continue with remaining steaks and remaining bacon.
14. Top each bacon wrapped filet with one or two small sprigs of fresh thyme and a bit of salt.
15. Place each wrapped steak in a suitable VacMaster bag and using a VacMaster chamber or suction machine vacuum pack the filet.
16. Cook for the filets in the SV1 for a minimum of two hours and up to six.
17. Pull the steaks from the SV1 and after removing from the bag(s) pat dry with paper towels and moisten with a bit of oil.
18. Sear the filets in large heavy bottomed cast iron skillet or similar over high heat browning the steak by rotating until golden brown on all sides.
19. Remove from the pan and serve immediately with the whipped horseradish cream.

**For the whipped horseradish cream:**

1. In a stand mixer or similar whisk the heavy cream until thick but not too stiff.
2. Fold the horseradish, coarse and dijon mustards into the cream.
3. Season to taste with Salt and Pepper.
4. Serve immediately.
