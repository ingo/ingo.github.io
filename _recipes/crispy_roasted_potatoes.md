A perfect side dish or a meal on its own. This recipe for crispy roasted potatoes, or "roasties" as they're known in England, came from a time of change and transition. Despite the ups and downs of life, the comforting ritual of making these roasties remained a constant. Now, they're a beloved dish shared at potlucks and Friendsgiving dinners, a testament to the enduring power of good food and the memories we make while preparing it.

### Ingredients

* `1/4 cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `8 to 10` red potatoes (2 to 3 pounds total), preferably similar in size, peeled and cut into 2- to 3-inch chunks
* `2 tbsp` flour
* `2 to 3` fresh rosemary sprigs (optional; okay to substitute dried rosemary)
* `3 to 4` chopped cloves garlic (optional)
* Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the rack in the middle. Add the oil to a rimmed sheet pan (13-by-18-inches) and place it in the oven.
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the potatoes and boil until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the potatoes in a colander and sprinkle with the flour. Shake the colander to distribute the flour evenly.
3. Carefully remove the pan with the hot oil from the oven. Spread the potatoes out in a single layer in the hot pan. The potatoes should sizzle upon making contact with the hot oil. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast the potatoes for about 1 hour, until golden brown. Every 15 to 20 minutes, flip the potato pieces, ensuring that all sides brown evenly. About 45 minutes into cooking, sprinkle the potatoes with the rosemary and/or the garlic, if using. Transfer to a cooling rack and generously season with the salt and serve.

### Notes

- The recipe can be adjusted to taste. Sometimes, chopped garlic is added toward the end, or the potatoes are dusted with fresh rosemary. If the potatoes aren't crispy enough, they can be tossed back in the oven and the heat cranked up. If they come out dry, more olive oil can be added to the pan. For anything else, just sprinkle them with more Maldon salt.
