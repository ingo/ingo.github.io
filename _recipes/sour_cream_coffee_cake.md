It's quite rich, so your serving sizes don't need to be large. This Sour-Cream Coffee Cake is a classic breakfast delight, featuring a tender crumb and a crunchy streusel topping. Despite its richness, the serving sizes don't need to be large, making it perfect for sharing.

### Ingredients

#### For the cake:

* `½ cup/113 grams` unsalted butter at room temperature 
* `1 ¼ cups/260 grams` sugar 
* `2` large eggs 
* `1 ½ cups/188 grams` flour 
* `1 ½ teaspoons` baking powder 
* `½ teaspoon` baking soda 
* `½ teaspoon` salt 
* `1 ¼ cups/300 grams` sour cream 
* `1 teaspoon` vanilla 

#### For the topping:

* `½ cup/104 grams` sugar 
* `2 teaspoons` all-purpose flour 
* `1 tablespoon` cinnamon 
* `⅓ cup/70 grams` chopped pecans or walnuts 

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and generously butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
2. In a separate bowl, sift flour with baking powder, baking soda and salt. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture alternately with sour cream and vanilla until just combined. Do not overmix. Pour batter into prepared baking pan.
3. Make the topping: Combine sugar, cinnamon, flour and nuts in a small bowl and mix well.
4. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the cake and bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool, cut into pieces and serve.
