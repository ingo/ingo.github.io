### Ingredients

* `2` acorn squash halved
* `1 tbsp` La Tourangelle Walnut Oil
* `½ cup` onion diced finely
* `½ tbsp` minced garlic
* `1 lb` ground beef
* `1½ cups` baby bella mushrooms chopped
* `¼ cup` dried figs chopped
* `½ cup` chicken stock
* `1 tsp` fresh rosemary chopped
* `1 tsp` fresh sage chopped
* `1 tsp` pepper
* `½ tsp` salt
* `½ cup` pecans chopped
* `1 cup` shredded cheddar cheese

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat baking sheet. Grease baking sheet lightly with walnut oil to prevent squash from sticking.
2. Slice acorn squash in half, scoop out seeds and place flat on sheet greased with walnut oil. Bake the squash for 20 minutes, until it is tender when pierced with a fork.
3. While the squash cooks – heat La Tourangelle Walnut Oil in large pan. Sauté onions and garlic until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add in ground beef and cook for an additional 10 minutes until browned.
4. Once meat is browned, add in chopped mushrooms, dried figs, chicken stock, pecans, herbs, pepper and salt to the pan with the beef. Sauté for an additional 5 minutes.
5. When the squash is done, remove from the oven + scoop out most of the cooked center, leaving the mostly empty squash ‘boat’ on the baking sheet.
6. Add the squash filling to the beef/veggie/mushroom mixture in the pan + stir until completely mixed in. Scoop the beef/squash mixture back into the empty squash + top with cheese.
7. Bake them at 450 for 5-10 minutes until cheese melts, and then broil for 2-3 minutes so the cheesy gets crispy.
