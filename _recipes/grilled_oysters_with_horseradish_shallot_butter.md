title: Grilled Oysters with Horseradish-Shallot Butter
---


This grilled oysters recipe with horseradish-shallot butter is inspired by the Epicurious grilled oysters trick, where oysters pop open on the grill so you don’t have to fuss over shucking, and classic compound butter techniques you see in barbecue oyster recipes online.

### Ingredients

#### For the oysters
* `24` fresh oysters, scrubbed clean
* Lemon wedges, for serving
  
#### For the horseradish-shallot butter
* `1/4 cup` (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened
* `2 tbsp` prepared horseradish (more if you like a kick)
* `1` small shallot, finely minced
* `1–2 tsp` lemon juice
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### Directions
1. In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, prepared horseradish, minced shallot, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth. Refrigerate while you prepare the oysters so the flavors meld.
2. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Clean the grill grates so the oysters won’t stick.
3. Place the oysters directly on the grill, flat side up. The heat will make the shells pop open slightly, giving you a chance to finish the job or simply access the interior easily. Grill for about 3–4 minutes until they just begin to open.
4. Using heatproof gloves/tongs, transfer the oysters to a tray. Remove the top shell (if they opened; otherwise carefully pry them with an oyster knife).
5. Add a spoonful or pat of horseradish-shallot butter to each oyster in its bottom shell. The heat will melt the butter and mingle with the oyster’s liquor.
6. Place back on the grill briefly (60 seconds) just to melt the butter and warm through. Remove when the liquid starts to bubble.
7. Serve hot with lemon wedges.

### Notes
- For easier portioning, you can spoon dollops of the compound butter onto a piece of parchment and chill briefly until firm, then cut into small pats.
- Pair with crusty bread to soak up butter and oyster juices.
- A cold glass of crisp white wine, dry rosé, or a light beer complements the briny oysters.
- Add a dash of hot sauce or a sprinkle of chives for brightness.
