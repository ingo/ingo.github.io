### Ingredients

* `400g` Habanero Chilis
* `250g` Piri Piri Chilis (exchange with Cayennes, Birds Eye or similar)
* A couple of yellow JalapeÃ±o peppers for mild fruity heat (optional. I had them laying around)
* `1` large Carrot (~160g)
* `1` large parsnip (~130g)
* `3` garlic cloves
* 5% Brine --> **Per Liter**; `950g` chlorine free water, `50g` salt without additives (sea salt, rock salt or kosher salt)

### Directions

1. Wash all ingredients to remove dirt and any residues of pesticides.
2. De-seed all chilis and chop roughly (prevents air pockets from forming in the jar).
3. Peel and chop carrots and parsnip roughly.
4. Peel and crush the garlic cloves.
5. Add everything to the jar and pack it.
6. Top up with brine, so that it covers all and everything is submerged. Use a spoon to pack it and get rid of any air pockets.
7. Weigh down the vegetables with pickle weighs, or simply a small, sealed plastic bag filled with brine.
8. Let sit in room temp, away from direct sunlight for about two weeks, minimum seven days.
9. After the ferment, strain the vegetables (keep the brine!).
10. Mix thoroughly in a kitchen mixer/blender (don't let it get hot, since it can kill the culture).
11. Add brine back to the mix, until it has the desired consistency.
12. Bottle and keep refrigerated.

### Variations

* Add a splash of fresh lemon, lime or fruity vinegar when mixing. This not only brings out the taste, it makes it more shelf stable.
* Add Mango cubes or Plums to the ferment for the last 4-5 days to make it more tropical and fruity.
* Add cane sugar.

### Notes

* Use gloves and work fast!
* (optional) Checking pH. See below.
* It should keep for a couple of months at least.
* Regularly available pH strips will do, in case you feel like checking. The picture below shows a reading of a pH value sitting nicely between 3 - 4.
