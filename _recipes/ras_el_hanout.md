Ras el Hanout is a North African Spice mix that is pungent and earthy with a balance of sweet and bitter elements, as well as floral notes. Its name translates from Arabic as "head of the shop" because all the best spices go into it!

### Ingredients

* `1 tbsp` ground ginger
* `1 tbsp` ground coriander
* `2 tsp` red chilli powder
* `2 tsp` paprika
* `2 tsp` ground cumin
* `2 tsp` ground cinnamon
* `2 tsp` ground allspice
* `2 tsp` ground black pepper
* `2 tsp` ground turmeric
* `1 1/2 tsp` ground orris root
* `1 1/2 tsp` ground mace
* `1 1/2 tsp` ground nutmeg
* `1 1/2 tsp` ground cardamom
* `3/4 tsp` ground fennel seed
* `3/4 tsp` ground anise seed
* `1/2 tsp` ground fenugreek
* `1/2 tsp` ground cloves
* `1/2 tsp` cayenne pepper
* `2` bay leaves ground in a spice mill and strained through a fine mesh sieve (about 1/8 + 1/16 teaspoon ground)
* `1 tsp` dried lavender organic culinary-grade, ground in a spice mill and strained through a fine mesh sieve (about 1/2 teaspoon ground)
* `1 tbsp` dried rose petals organic culinary-grade, ground in a spice mill and strained through a fine mesh sieve (about 1 1/4 teaspoon ground)

### Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, and store the spice mix in an airtight container in the pantry.

### Notes

* Recipe Yield and Serving Size: This recipe makes about 70 grams of spice mix, which is about 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons. For the purposes of nutritional information, each serving is 1 tablespoon for a total of 10 (1-tablespoon) servings.
* Storage: This will stay good for up to 2 years. However, for the best flavor I like to use it within 6 months.
