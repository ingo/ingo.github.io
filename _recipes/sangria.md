description: During my time in Madrid, I fell in love with a refreshing, fruity concoction
  called sangria. My recipe discovery happened unexpectedly in a small Andalusian
  town during a grape harvest festival, where the third-generation winemaker Don Eduardo
  shared his treasured family recipe. Back home, I couldn't wait to recreate this
  authentic sangria, bringing a touch of Spanish tradition to my gatherings.
