title: Whiskey-Laced Pecan Pie

Cookbook author Tipton-Martin writes that in slavery days, molasses pie, a cinnamon-spiced syrup-based pie without nuts, was a Christmas treat. Later on, other ingredients started to appear: grated orange zest or coconut, melted chocolate or chocolate chips, and pie crusts made from all kinds of ingredients from crushed cookies to zwieback toasts. Tipton-Martin, however, has a soft spot for the traditional pecan pie so many expect at their Thanksgiving dessert buffets.

### Ingredients

For the crust
* `3 cups` flour, plus more for rolling
* `3/4 tsp` kosher salt
* `1 1/2 sticks` unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled
* `6 tbsp` lard or shortening, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled (can substitute more butter)
* `12 to 15 tbsp` ice water

For the pie
* `1 1/2 cups` chopped toasted pecans, plus `3/4 cup` pecan halves
* `2 tbsp` whiskey or rum
* `6 tbsp` unsalted butter, at room temperature
* `1 cup` packed dark brown sugar
* `3/4 cup` dark brown corn syrup
* `3` large eggs, beaten
* `1/4 tsp` kosher salt
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract

### Directions

1. Make the pie crust: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Sprinkle half of the butter and lard over the flour and use your fingertips, a pastry blender or two knives to cut and mix until the mixture resembles large peas. Sprinkle in the remaining butter and lard and cut and mix until you're left with coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the dough with ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and use a fork to lightly mix until the dough just comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Gather the dough into a ball. Divide the ball in half. Press into two 1-inch-thick disks and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling, or freeze for later use. You will use 1 for this pie; save the other for a future pie.
2. Make the pie: Place the chopped, toasted pecans in a small bowl and toss with the whiskey or rum until coated. Let stand 1 hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees with the rack in the middle.
4. Over a generously floured counter, roll the disk of dough out to roughly a 13-inch circle. Transfer it to a 9-inch pie pan, then trim and tuck excess crust and crimp as you like.
5. Using a hand mixer on medium, beat the butter and brown sugar until light, about 3 minutes. Mix in the corn syrup, eggs, salt and vanilla. Stir in the whiskey-soaked pecans. Pour into the pie shell, and arrange the pecan halves on top in an attractive pattern.
6. Bake 55 to 60 minutes, until the filling is set but still has a slight jiggle in the middle. Cool the pie slightly, then serve warm or at room temperature.

### Notes

- Toast the pecan halves in a small, dry skillet over medium-low heat for a few minutes, until fragrant and lightly browned. Cool completely before using.
