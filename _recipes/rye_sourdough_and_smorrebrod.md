---
This recipe is inspired by the traditional Danish open-faced sandwich, Smørrebrød. The hearty rye sourdough bread serves as a perfect base for a variety of toppings. The bread is made using a combination of sifted rye flour, whole grain rye flour, and freshly milled whole grain spelt. The dough is then fermented and baked to perfection. 

### Ingredients

* `234g` Sifted Rye Flour (Central Milling Medium Rye)
* `176g` Whole Grain Rye Flour (Central Milling Whole Rye)
* `176g` Freshly Milled Whole Grain Spelt
* `468g` Water
* `88g` Dark beer (stout, black lager, etc.)
* `12g` Fine sea salt
* `47g` Sourdough starter
* `65g` Sunflower Seeds (unsalted)
* `65g` Pumpkin Seeds (hulled & unsalted)
* `30g` Flaxseeds (raw)

### Directions

1. Prepare the levain and soaker the night before you plan to bake.
2. Let the levain ferment for 12 hours overnight at room temperature, about 70-72°F (21-22°C).
3. Toast the seeds for the soaker and soak them in hot water for the same duration as your levain.
4. Drain the seed mixture using a fine-mesh sieve and let sit while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
5. Add the levain to a mixing bowl along with the beer and the room temperature water and stir around to dissolve the levain.
6. Add in all the dry ingredients plus the drained seed mixture. Mix well with wet hands or a spatula.
7. Cover the bowl and let bulk ferment for 30 minutes at 74°F (23°C) ambient temperature.
8. Lightly grease your Pullman pan and scoop out the dough into your greased Pullman pan. Smooth the top with wet hands or a spatula.
9. Let proof, covered with reusable plastic, for 1.5 to 2 hours at around 74°F (23°C).
10. Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C) and bake for 35 minutes at 400°F (204°C).
11. Turn the heat down to 350°F (176°C) and bake for 1.5 to 2 hours until the internal temperature reaches 208-210°F (97-98°C).
12. Once your bread has finished baking, remove the lid to your Pullman pan and let sit on a wire rack until cool to the touch.
13. Gently remove the bread from the pan, wrap in a kitchen towel or baker’s linen and let it rest on the counter for 24-48 hours.

### Notes

* No stretch and folds are necessary.
* Be flexible with your baking duration and check the loaf periodically towards the end.
* There is no need to steam your oven for this bread if you’re baking with the lid on.
* If you slice too soon, you’ll end up with a gummy interior.
