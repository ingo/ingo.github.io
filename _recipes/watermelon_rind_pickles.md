This recipe first appeared on altonbrown.com. Watermelon rind pickles are the finest thing you can do with a watermelon besides greasing it up and chasing it around the pool.

### Ingredients

* `2 pounds` watermelon rind, from a roughly 5-pound watermelon
* `1 cup` apple cider vinegar
* `1 cup` water
* `3/4 cup` sugar
* `1/4 cup` chopped candied or crystalized ginger 
* `4 teaspoons` kosher salt
* `1 teaspoon` red pepper flake
* `1 teaspoon` allspice berries
* `1` star anise pod

### Directions

1. Using a sharp peeler, remove and discard the exterior green portion of the watermelon rind. You should now have rind that is mostly white, with a little bit of pink and/or red on one side. Cut into 1-inch cubes. 
2. Add the apple cider vinegar, water, sugar, ginger, salt, and spices to a 2-quart saucepan set over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and hold for 1 minute, then carefully add the watermelon. Return to a boil and turn off the heat. Remove the pan from heat and cool for 30 minutes.
3. Move the pickles to a 2-quart jar using a canning funnel and ladle. Pour on as much of the pickling juice as possible. Cover the jar and leave at room temperature for another 1 1/2 hours.
4. Refrigerate overnight and consume within a month. These pickles must be refrigerated.
