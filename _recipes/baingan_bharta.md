This smoky eggplant mash is delicious
  with naan or rice. Grilling or broiling the eggplant gives it a delicious charred
  flavor. The pulp is then mashed with spices and simmered into a creamy vegetable
  side dish or dip. The smokiness pairs wonderfully with the aromatics. Enjoy baingan
  bharta as a vegan main dish or side.
