This Orange-Blossom Clotted Cream is a delightful addition to any dessert. Its unique flavor profile enhances the taste of almond, orange, and lemon cakes, hot fruit tarts, and roasted peaches. The secret to its rich, creamy texture lies in the slow cooking process and overnight rest.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` cream
* `1/4 cup` sour cream
* `2 tablespoons` mild-flavored honey
* `1` zest of orange, finely grated
* `1 teaspoon` orange-blossom water

### Directions

1. Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan and very, very slowly bring them to the boil.
2. As soon as the cream boils, lower the heat and keep it at a low simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Tip it into a glass bowl and leave it overnight, outside the refrigerator, wrapped in a blanket.
4. Refrigerate until required.

### Notes

- The cream needs to be brought to a boil very slowly to prevent it from burning.
- The cream should be left outside the refrigerator overnight, wrapped in a blanket, to achieve the perfect texture.
- Refrigerate the cream until it is required for use.
