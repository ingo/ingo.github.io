title: Whole Salmon Fillet on the Grill with Lemons
---

### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` Hy-Vee stone ground mustard
* `2 tbsp` Hy-Vee less-sodium soy sauce
* `1 tbsp` Hy-Vee honey
* `2 cloves` garlic, minced
* `1 tsp` fresh thyme, chopped, plus additional sprigs for garnish
* `10` lemons, cut into 1/4-inch slices
* `1` (1-1/2-to-2-lbs.) skin-on Alaska sockeye salmon fillet

### Directions

1. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill with greased grill rack for direct cooking over medium-high heat.
2. Combine mustard, soy sauce, honey, garlic, and chopped thyme in a small bowl; set aside.
3. Lay lemon slices on grill rack; spread them out and overlap the slices. Pat salmon dry. Place salmon on top of lemon slices and brush with half of the mustard glaze. Grill for 15 to 20 minutes, or until fish flakes with a fork (145 degrees), brushing with remaining glaze halfway through. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.
