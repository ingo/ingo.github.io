---

This dish is a perfect blend of flavors, with the rich taste of duck breast perfectly complemented by the earthy morels and the sweet Marsala sauce. It's a great choice for a special occasion or a fancy dinner at home.

### Ingredients

* `20g` dried morel mushrooms
* `2` star anise
* `4` duck breasts
* `1` small red onion, peeled and finely chopped
* `150ml` dry Marsala
* `4tbsp` double cream

### Directions

1. Soak the morels in 100ml boiling water for half an hour. Drain and squeeze dry, reserving the water.
2. Crush the star anise in a spice grinder or mortar, and rub into the duck skin and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover with cling film and leave to marinate for half an hour.
3. Heat a heavy-based frying pan and, once it is hot, add the duck breasts skin-side-down. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until the skin is brown and crisp. Pour off any excess oil, turn the duck over and cook the other side for 5 minutes.
4. Add the red onion as the second side cooks, stirring it around in the duck fat. Once the duck is cooked through, add the morels and Marsala to the pan and gently bubble everything together for 5 minutes.
5. Pour over the double cream and shake the pan to blend it into the sauce. Season well.
6. Lift the duck out of the sauce and either serve it whole or slice the breasts thinly on the diagonal. Serve with some sauce spooned over.
