title: Chicken Kataifi Schnitzel with Schug Tehina
---
This recipe was adapted from the menu of K'Far, a Brooklyn restaurant. The crispy chicken schnitzel is coated with a crunchy kataifi crust and served with a spicy schug tehina sauce. You can typically find kataifi in the Middle Eastern section of a supermarket or order it online.

### Ingredients

Tehina (makes 4 cups)
* `1` clove garlic 
* `1` lemon, juiced 
* `1 (16-ounce)` jar tehina (aka tahini)
* `1 tbsp` kosher salt
* `1 tsp` ground cumin 
* `1-1Â½ cups` ice water 

Schug (makes about 2 cups)
* `1/2 lb` stemmed serrano chiles 
* `3 tbsp` kosher salt 
* `3 tbsp` lemon juice 
* `2 tbsp` canola oil 
* `2 tsp` ground coriander 

Schnitzel
* `2` chicken breasts 
* `2 tsp` kosher salt 
* `1/2 cup` all-purpose flour 
* `2` eggs
* `2 cups` finely chopped kataifi (1/2-inch strands) 
* `1/2 cup` canola oil, as needed 
*  sea salt, for serving

### Directions

**For the tehina:**
1. Nick off a piece of the garlic (about a quarter of the clove) and drop it into a food processor.
2. Squeeze the lemon juice into the food processor. Pour the tehina on top, making sure to scrape it all out of the container, and add the salt and cumin.
3. Process until the mixture looks peanut buttery, about 1 minute.
4. Stream in the ice water, a little at a time, with the motor running. Process just until the mixture is smooth and creamy and lightens to the color of dry sand.

**For the schug:**
1. Combine the serrano chiles and kosher salt in a food processor and process until smooth.
2. Transfer to a bowl and stir in lemon juice, canola oil and ground coriander.
3. Taste and add more salt if needed. This keeps, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 weeks.
4. Mix together 1 cup of tehina sauce and 1 tablespoon of schug in a small bowl. Taste and add salt and a squeeze of lemon juice as needed. Refrigerate in a covered container for up to a week.

**For the schnitzel:**
1. Using a meat pounder, pound both chicken breasts until thin.
2. Season chicken breasts liberally with salt on both sides, 1 teaspoon per breast.
3. Add 1/2 cup of flour to a plate, whisk one egg in a bowl, and place kataifi strands on a plate.
4. Roll chicken breasts in flour, pat out any extra flour, submerge in egg wash then roll in kataifi.
5. Fill a Dutch oven with 1/2 inch of oil for frying. Bring the oil to 350 F.
6. Fry the schnitzel until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165 F, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side.
7. Remove from the pan and drain on a resting rack or on a plate with paper towels.
8. Plate with a sprinkle of sea salt and serve with the schug tehina on the side.

### Notes

**Swap option:** Canola oil, peanut oil, safflower oil and vegetable oil can all work, but I would not use avocado oil.

**Special equipment:** Food processor.
