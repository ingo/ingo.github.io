### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil
* `1` 3-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces
* `Salt and freshly ground white pepper` to taste
* `2 tbsp` unsalted butter
* `12` cipollini onions, peeled and trimmed
* `4` shallots, peeled and trimmed
* `2` heads garlic, cloves separated but not peeled
* `3 sprigs` thyme
* `4` small Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-1/2-inch chunks
* `2 ounces` slab bacon, cut into short, thin strips
* `12` small crimini or oyster mushrooms, trimmed and cleaned
* `2 cups` unsalted Chicken Stocken or store-bought low sodium chicken broth

### Directions

1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375
2. Working over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil in a large ovenproof sauté pan or skillet—choose one with high sides and a cover. Season the chicken pieces all over with salt and pepper, slip them into the pan, and cook until they are well-browned on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes. Take your time—you want a nice deep color and you also want to partially cook the chicken at this point. When the chicken is deeply golden, transfer it to a platter and keep it in a warm place while you work on the vegetables.
3. Pour off all but two tablespoons of the cooking fat from the pan. Lower the heat to medium, add the butter, onions, shallots, garlic, and thyme, and cook and stir just until the vegetables start to take on a little color, about three minutes. Add the potatoes, celery root, and bacon and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just to start rendering the bacon fat. Cover the pan and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes.
4. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and return the chicken to the pan. Add the chicken stock, bring to the boil, and slide them into the pan. Bake, uncovered, for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Spoon everything onto a warm serving platter or into an attractive casserole.
5. To serve: Bring the chicken to the table, with plenty of pieces or crusty baguette to sop up the sauce and spread with the soft, sweet, caramely garlic that is easily squeezed out of the skin.

### Notes

Serve with crusty baguette to sop up the sauce and spread with the soft, sweet, caramely garlic that is easily squeezed out of the skin.
