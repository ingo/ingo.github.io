  \ These large white beans are slow simmered in a rich tomato and herb sauce until\

  \ soak up the flavors of the aromatic sauce."

These giant beans were first discovered during a trip to Athens. They are huge in size, and huge in flavor. This recipe is intensely comforting and satisfying. It’s also incredibly versatile. You can serve it as a stew-like main course, as a side dish, or even as part of a spread of small plates or appetizers. 

### Ingredients

* `1 pound` dry gigantes beans - soaked overnight
* `2` medium yellow onions - peeled and chopped
* `4 cloves` garlic - peeled and smashed
* `2 14.5-ounce cans` no-salt-added diced tomatoes
* `2 cups` vegetarian chicken broth - or water
* `2` bay leaves
* `1 teaspoon` dried oregano
* `1/2 teaspoon` dried thyme
* `1/4 teaspoon` red pepper flakes
* `1 teaspoon` salt
* `1 teaspoon` sugar
* `2 tablespoons` extra virgin olive oil
* Crusty bread - black pepper, and more olive oil for serving

### Directions

1. Boil the beans for 10 minutes.
2. Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a large slow cooker. Cook for 4-6 hours on high, or 8-10 hours on low. Taste and add more salt as needed.
3. Serve with toasted crusty bread. Garnish with freshly ground black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.

### Notes

* In the winter, a dash of cinnamon added to the mix would be heavenly.
* If you forget to soak the beans overnight, you can usually get away with adding an extra hour (on high) or two (on low) to the cook time.
* Cooking these Greek beans on low produces a better result, as it doesn’t aggressively boil the beans which can cause a lot of bean-skin separation.
