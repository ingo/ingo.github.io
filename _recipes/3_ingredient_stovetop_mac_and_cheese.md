This 3-Ingredient Stovetop Mac and Cheese is a quick and easy recipe that brings the comfort of homemade food to your table in just 15 minutes. Created by J. Kenji López-Alt, this recipe proves that you don't need a long list of ingredients to make a delicious and satisfying meal.

### Ingredients
* `6 ounces` elbow macaroni
* Salt
* `6 ounces` evaporated milk
* `6 ounces` grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or any good melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruyère, or Jack

### Directions
1. Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently.
2. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.
3. Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese.
4. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.

### Notes
* If you are willing to kick the total ingredients up to more than three, try a good dash of hot sauce, some mustard powder, or a little knob of butter stirred in with the evaporated milk.
* Special Equipment: Medium saucepan or skillet.
