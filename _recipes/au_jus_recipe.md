### Ingredients

* `4 tbsp` butter or beef drippings
* `2 tbsp` all-purpose flour (see Notes for gluten free or paleo)
* `¼ cup` red wine or beef broth
* `2 cups` beef broth, divided
* `1 tbsp` Worcestershire sauce
* `to taste` salt & pepper

### Directions

1. In saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter (or beef drippings) then sprinkle in flour. Whisk thoroughly until thin paste forms.
2. Vigorously mix red wine into flour mixture. Mixture will likely become purple and gooey. Continue cooking over medium-high heat for 2 minutes or until sharp alcohol smell is gone.
3. Slowly pour in ½ cup of beef broth. Whisk vigorously to combine.
4. Once beef broth is incorporated, pour in remaining broth and Worcestershire sauce. Bring mixture to boil and cook 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. 
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve and enjoy!

### Notes

* **Make it Gluten-Free:** Use 2 tablespoons gluten-free all-purpose flour in place of the all-purpose flour. Make sure your Worcestershire sauce is gluten-free, too.
* **Make it Paleo:** Use 2 tablespoons cassava flour in place of the all-purpose flour.
