title: "The Surprising Science of Dry Hopping \u2013 Lessons from Tom Shellhammer"
---
Last week, I attended parts of the Ohio Craft Brewer’s conference, held at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Columbus. The most interesting aspect of the conference was Tom Shellhammer’s keynote address. Shellhammer, the Norwester Professor of Fermentation Science at Oregon State University, is internationally recognized for his research on hop chemistry. His presentation at OCBC focused entirely on the chemistry of dry hopping (adding hops to the beer during conditioning and/or fermentation). This brewing technique figures prominently in many styles, most notably American IPAs of every description. Shellhammer’s talk featured three vignettes, each of which had a clear take home message that I attempt to summarize below.

### When more is not always more

The first segment of the talk asked the question, does using larger quantities of dry hops lead to more hop aroma? To answer this question Shellhammer and his colleagues started with base pale ale (4.75% abv) that was very lightly hopped (19 IBU), and dry hopped it with whole cone Cascade hops for 24 hours. The variable they chose to explore was the quantity of dry hops, which ranged from 2 g/L to 16 g/L. 

### Does dry hopping lead to bitterness?

Until very recently brewers and brewing scientists attributed hop bitterness almost entirely to isomerized alpha acids that are produced in the boiling wort. The alpha acids found in hops are themselves not particularly bitter and have very little solubility in water, but in the harsh conditions of the boil they are isomerized, which in layman’s terms means that the molecule changes its shape (and polarity) by rearranging its atoms. This change increases both bitterness and solubility. At fermentation temperatures where dry hopping occurs there is not enough heat to isomerize the alpha acids, so the conventional thinking was that dry hopping does not add bitterness. 

### Hop Creep

The final, and arguably most interesting, segment of the talk explored the phenomenon of hop creep. It refers to the process whereby additional fermentation is triggered by dry hopping. Shellhammer described an experiment, which is summarized in the graph below taken from his 2018 article in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.
