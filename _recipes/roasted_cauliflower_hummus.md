It’s creamy, savory, and veggie-packed. Cauliflower hummus is a unique take on the traditional hummus recipe. Instead of using chickpeas, this recipe uses roasted cauliflower, making it a low-carb and easily digestible option. It's a great way to sneak more veggies into your daily routine. 

### Ingredients

* `1` large head cauliflower, approx 5 cups florets
* `3 tbsp` olive oil, divided
* `1/4 cup` tahini
* `2 tbsp` water, or more for desired consistency
* `juice from 1` lemon
* `1` garlic clove
* `1/4 tsp` salt
* `1/4 tsp` ground cumin
* `pinch of` ground coriander
* `pepper,` to taste
* `garnish with` olive oil, sunflower seeds and chopped parsley

### Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.
2. Remove the florets from the head of cauliflower and place on a baking tray. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil (or avocado oil) and toss to combine. Place the baking tray in the oven and roast for 20 minutes.
3. Transfer the cauliflower to your Vitamix or a food processor. Add the tahini, remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, water, lemon juice, garlic clove, salt, cumin and coriander. Add pepper to taste. Blend on high until smooth and creamy.
4. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with sunflower seeds and chopped parsley.

### Notes

- If your cauliflower hummus is a bit thick, just add more water (a teaspoon at a time) until it's your desired level of creaminess.
