It's a luxurious dish that is amazingly quick to prepare. This recipe is a luxurious dish that is amazingly quick to prepare. You simply grind the ingredients together in a food processor. Scallops, shrimp and such delicate fish as pike and sole are favorites, but I also love salmon mousseline for its flavor and color. 

### Ingredients

* `1 1/2 pounds` scallops
* `2` egg whites
* `1 teaspoon` salt
* Dash freshly ground white pepper
* Dash freshly grated nutmeg
* `1 3/4 cups` whipping cream

### Directions

1. Rinse scallops and dry thoroughly. Puree scallops in food processor until smooth. Add egg whites and puree again until very smooth. Cover and refrigerate in food processor container 30 minutes.
2. Add salt, white pepper and nutmeg to mixture. Return container to food processor base and with machine running, gradually pour in cream. To adjust seasonings to taste, drop 1 teaspoon of mousseline into gently simmering water 1 or 2 minutes until cooked through, then taste. (Neither egg nor seafood should be tasted raw.) Adjust seasonings to taste. Refrigerate 15 minutes or up to 4 hours.
3. Generously butter 6 (3/4-cup) ramekins. Fill each nearly to top with scallop mixture. Set ramekins in shallow pan. Add enough hot water to come halfway up sides of ramekins. Cover with buttered parchment paper or foil. Bake at 400 degrees about 15 minutes or until mixture is firm (wood pick inserted in center should come out clean). Remove ramekins from oven and water bath and keep warm. Unmold mousselines onto plates short time before serving.

### Notes

- Serve Scallop Mousselines with Parsley Sauce or Tomato Vinaigrette, or with your favorite tomato sauce.
