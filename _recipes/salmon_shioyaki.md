title: Salmon Shioyaki
---

This quick cooking technique produces salmon with an umami-flavored salty crust and crispy skin. We've added an addictive, shake-on seasoning you can get at Asian grocery stores or online to amplify the flavors. This recipe is shared by Taichi Kitamura, chef of Kappo Tamura restaurant in Seattle. It's been his favorite way to eat fish since his childhood in Kyoto, Japan.

### Ingredients

* `4` sockeye salmon fillets (each 5 to 6 oz., 1/2 to 1 in. thick), with skin
* `1 1/2 teaspoons` fine sea salt
* `1 tablespoon` vegetable oil
* Hot cooked sushi rice such as Nishiki or other short- to medium-grain rice
* `4` sheets nori (about 8 in. square), each cut into 6 pieces
* Lemon wedges
* Furikake (Japanese rice seasoning)

### Directions

1. Set salmon on a cooling rack in a rimmed pan, sprinkle fillets all over with sea salt, and chill uncovered at least 2 hours and as long as 5 hours.
2. Heat grill to medium-high (about 450Â°). Fold a 12- by 20-in. sheet of heavy-duty foil in half crosswise. With a knife tip, poke dime-size holes through foil about 2 in. apart. Oil one side of foil. Rub fish all over with oil.
3. Set foil with oiled side up on cooking grate. Set fillets slightly separated, skin side down, on foil. Grill, covered, until fish is barely cooked through, 7 to 12 minutes. With a wide spatula, slide fish from skin to a platter and tent with foil. Cook skin on foil until crisp, 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove foil from grill, then gently peel off skin, using fingers or a wide spatula (skin may break into pieces).
4. Serve salmon immediately with crispy skin, rice, nori, lemon, and furikake.
