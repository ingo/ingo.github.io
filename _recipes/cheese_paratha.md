Cheese paratha is a delicious whole wheat unleavened flatbread stuffed with a cheesy savory stuffing made with cheddar cheese, onions, green chilies and black pepper. These cheese flatbreads make for a wholesome breakfast or brunch. 

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` whole wheat flour
* `¼ tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` oil or ghee
* `½ cup` tightly packed grated cheese – cheddar, mozzarella or processed cheese
* `¼ cup` finely chopped onions
* `1 or 2` green chilies – finely chopped
* `¼ to ½ tsp` crushed black pepper or as required
* Ghee or oil as required for roasting paratha
* Whole wheat flour as needed for dusting

### Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl or plate/tray take whole wheat flour, salt, oil or ghee. Add some water.
2. Mix everything and begin to knead into a smooth and soft dough. Add more water if required while kneading. Cover and keep the dough aside for 20 to 30 minutes.
3. In a bowl or plate, take all the stuffing ingredients – grated cheese, finely chopped onions and green chillies, crushed black pepper. Mix everything very well. No need to add salt as cheese already has a lot of salt. Keep aside.
4. Pinch two small balls from the dough. Roll them between your palms. Flatten them and dust with whole wheat flour.
5. With a rolling pin, roll them into about 4 to 5 inches diameter rounds. Try making both the rounds of the same size.
6. On one of the rolled dough circle, place the cheese stuffing in the center and keep about 1 inch empty space from the sides.
7. Gently place the second circle on top and press and seal the edges with your fingertips.
8. Dust some flour on the stuffed paratha. Begin to roll the paratha. Dust some more flour if required.
9. Roll the paratha into a round of about 7 to 8 inches in diameter or about the size of a normal roti or chapati.
10. On a hot tava (skillet or griddle) place the rolled paratha. The tava should be hot and not at a low temperature. Cooking parathas at a low flame will harden them. Parathas ideally are crisp as well as soft.
11. When the base is partly cooked, flip the paratha. Spread some ghee on the partly cooked part.
12. Flip again and this time this side has to be cooked more than the previous side. You will see brown spots on the paratha.
13. Spread some ghee on this side too. Flip again once or twice till both the sides are cooked properly. You should see crisp brown spots on the paratha.
14. Press the paratha edges with a spatula or spoon, so that they are fried well. While roasting any paratha variety make sure that the edges are cooked properly. If not then press them with the help of spatula for even cooking.
15. Once the paratha has cooked well. Remove them from the tava and serve them hot. Make all parathas this way.
16. Serve these cheese paratha hot with yogurt or mango pickle or tomato ketchup.

### Notes

Do chop the onions finely as if not, then they come out of the parathas while rolling. For a vegan cheese paratha, use your preferred vegan cheese and roast the paratha with any neutral flavored oil. The recipe can be doubled. The approximate nutrition info is for 1 cheese paratha made with cheddar cheese and roasted with ghee.
