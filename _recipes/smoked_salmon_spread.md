Perfect for serving with crudites or crackers. This smoked salmon spread is a delightful addition to any appetizer spread. The recipe comes from Ina Garten, known for her simple yet flavorful dishes.

### Ingredients

* `8 ounces` cream cheese, at room temperature
* `1/2 cup` sour cream
* `1 tablespoon` freshly squeezed lemon juice
* `1 tablespoon` minced fresh dill
* `1 teaspoon` prepared horseradish, drained
* `1/2 teaspoon` kosher salt
* `1/4 teaspoon` freshly ground black pepper
* `1/4 pound (4 ounces)` smoked salmon, minced

### Directions

1. Cream the cheese in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until just smooth.
2. Add the sour cream, lemon juice, dill, horseradish, salt, and pepper, and mix.
3. Add the smoked salmon and mix well.
4. Chill and serve with crudites or crackers.

### Notes

* If you can find it, I prefer Norwegian salmon; it's drier and less salty than other smoked salmon.
