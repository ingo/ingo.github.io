This recipe was inspired by a family trip to Spain, particularly Sevilla, during Semana Santa. The Tortas de Aceite, yeast-leavened olive oil wafers laced with sesame and anise, were a standout. This version is a little different than the standard torta in that it is leavened with sourdough and uses star anise instead of anise seed.

### Ingredients

* `6g` Sourdough starter, 60% hyd.
* `30g` KAF AP
* `18g` Water, room temp
* `180g` Unbleached AP, 10% protein
* `1Tb + 3/4 tsp` Sesame seeds, toasted
* `1 Tb` Sugar
* `1/4 tsp` Salt
* `108g` Water, room temp
* `32g` Levain
* `54g` Olive oil
* `1 piece` Star anise
* `2 tsp + 2 Tbs` Granulated sugar

### Directions

1. Night Before: Mix levain, allow to ferment overnight at 68-70F. It should rise but not yet be fully mature.
2. Next Morning: Weigh flour into mixing bowl and coat a 3-4 cup bulk ferment container with olive oil.
3. Use spice grinder to grind toasted sesame seeds, salt and main dough sugar until fine. Stir into flour.
4. Add 32g levain (the rest is for perpetuating the culture), water and oil to the flour mixture and mix until combined, then knead by hand about 10 minutes.
5. Transfer to oiled container and cover. Ferment until dough has doubled, about 5 hours at 81F.
6. Using olive oil to grease work surfaces and dough, stretch and fold 3 times in first 3.5 hours, then allow to rise. Ready when rounded peak reaches a little past 2 2/3 cups.
7. Afternoon: Divide and pre-shape into 12 rounds. Place on oiled sheet pan and rest one hour, covered.
8. In spice grinder, grind star anise with 2 tsp sugar until fine, then scrape into bowl.
9. Preheat oven to 450F, placing rack in middle of oven. Prep a half sheet pan with silpat or parchment.
10. Spread 2 Tbs granulated sugar on a plate.
11. Flatten dough balls slightly, then sprinkle the top with 1/4 tsp of the anise-sugar mixture. Spread mixture over dough disc with fingertip.
12. Shape six discs into pizza-like tortas about 3 1/2 inches in diameter, then turn face down in sugar plate to coat with sugar.
13. Place six tortas on one half sheet pan and bake 8 minutes, then rotate and bake 3-5 more minutes, until nicely caramelized.
14. Repeat with remaining six tortas.

### Notes

* Don't be tempted to add the anise into the main dough- it has potent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal qualities and will kill off every discernable trace of sourdough culture (did this with my first go at these).
* These re-heat and re-crisp beautifully in the toaster.
