### Ingredients

* `1 1/2 lbs` shrimp, shelled and deveined (20+ count per pound is suggested)
* `2-3 tbsp` unsalted butter
* `1` medium sweet onion (Maui, Vidalia, or other)
* `1/4 cup` beer (a light, sweet lager)
* `1 tbsp` lemon juice
* `2 tsp` fresh grated lemon zest
* `to taste` salt and pepper
* `optional` chopped parsley

### Directions

1. Peel and slice the onion very thinly into rings. 
2. Place the shrimp on a plate with a paper towel, pat dry, and salt and pepper to taste. 
3. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat until the foaming subsides and add the onion, stirring to break up the rings. Cook until soft, approximately several minutes. 
4. Remove the onion to a bowl and return the pan to the stove. If there is only a little butter left in the pan, add the remaining tablespoon.
5. Once the butter has melted again and the foaming subsided, add the shrimp to the pan in a single layer. Cook until one side is pink, and then flip immediately with a pair of tongs. 
6. Once the shrimp are fully cooked, remove from the pan into a bowl, leaving any liquid behind, and cover to keep warm.
7. Return the pan to the stove, and add the beer, lemon juice, and onion slices. Turn the heat to high, and let the sauce boil, thicken slightly. 
8. Add the lemon zest and parsley, and then turn off the heat. Pour the sauce over the shrimp and toss to combine. 
9. Serve immediately with rice or pasta and vegetables on the side.
