This Tuscan Grilled Trout recipe is a simple yet flavorful dish that's perfect for any occasion. The recipe was first published in Food & Wine magazine in January 2014 and has since been a favorite among readers.

### Ingredients

* `1/4 cup` olive oil
* `1` clove garlic, cut into thin slices
* `1/2 tsp` dried sage
* `1/2 tsp` dried rosemary, crumbled
* `2 tbsp` wine vinegar
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `1/4 tsp` fresh-ground black pepper
* `8` trout fillets (about 2 pounds in all)

### Directions

1. Light the grill or heat the broiler. In a small stainless-steel saucepan, combine the oil, garlic, sage, and rosemary. Cook over moderately low heat until the garlic just starts to brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and the pepper.
2. Put the trout fillets in a medium glass dish or stainless-steel pan. Sprinkle the fish with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Add half of the oil-and-vinegar mixture and turn to coat. Grill or broil the fish skin-side down for 2 minutes. Turn and cook until just done, about 2 minutes longer for 1/4-inch-thick fillets. To serve, whisk the remaining oil-and-vinegar mixture and pour it over the hot fish.

### Notes

- Fish Alternatives: In place of the trout, try relatively firm fillets, such as Arctic char or salmon. Whole fresh sardines, if you can find them, would also be delicious.
- Test-Kitchen Tip: If you don't plan to grill the trout right away, let the oil and vinegar cool completely before adding the mixture to the fish. Otherwise, the hot oil and vinegar will start to cook the fish immediately.
- Suggested Pairing: Look for a young white wine from Italy with plenty of acidity, such as a Pinot Grigio or Soave, to complement the trout and stand up to the vinegar here.
