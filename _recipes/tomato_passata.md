This recipe for tomato sauce is a staple in many kitchens. It's incredibly simple, requiring only fresh tomatoes and a bit of time. The result is a sauce that's perfect for pasta, pizza, and more.

### Ingredients

* tomatoes

### Directions

1. Slice each tomato in half and squeeze out the seeds. Save the liquid and use that to make Tomato water.
2. Place the cleaned tomatoes in a large pot, cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Cook the tomatoes until they are soft, not totally mashed. Roughly it will take about 20 minutes.
3. Place the tomatoes through a strainer machine or food mill to puree them well, crushing the skins and making the sauce perfectly smooth.
4. If the sauce is too liquid for you at this stage, place it in a very fine strainer to remove some of the liquid.
5. The sauce is now ready to use or can!

### Notes

- The amount of tomatoes needed will depend on how much sauce you want to make. As a general rule, 1 pound of tomatoes will yield approximately 1 cup of sauce.
- The sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to a week, or canned for longer storage.
- A Champion Juicer works very well to puree the sauce. There is a special large-hole tomato screen, but also running the spent pulp through the machine 2 times to extract any remaining liquid works great.
