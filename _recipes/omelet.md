This way, taken from a recipe by Tyler Florence, makes it easy to get a nice, fluffy specimen. The spelling of omelet vs. omelette comes out to a tie–evidently the latter is more common in Britain.

### Ingredients

* `6` eggs
* `3 tbsp.` butter
* `2 tbsp.` heavy cream
* `To taste` salt
* `To taste` pepper
* Optional: herbs, roasted mushrooms, or cheese

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 450° F.
2. Melt butter in a saucepan until it foams. Set aside and pour off clarified top. Clarifying the butter is not necessary, but normal melted butter will leave brown spots on the outside of the omelet.
3. Whisk eggs, heavy cream and pepper together in medium bowl. Pour 1-2 tbsp. melted butter into the bottom of a small ovenproof saucepan with sloping sides, and swirl pan to coat. Pour in half of the egg mixture. Using a rubber spatula, quickly start stirring the eggs in small circles, enough to make small curds evenly across the bottom of the pan. Once the eggs have begun to set, place the pan in the oven. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes until eggs are set and puffy, and remove pan from oven with a oven mitt.
4. Top omelet with cheese, herbs or mushrooms, season with salt and pepper as appropriate, and roll out omelet onto plate. Add remaining butter to plan, swirl to coat, and repeat process with second batch of eggs.
