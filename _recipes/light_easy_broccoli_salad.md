title: Light & Easy Broccoli Salad
---
Elizabeth's recipe for broccoli slaw has always been popular. It's very quick and easy, especially with the use of a food processor. The original recipe has been updated to specify broccoli weight for clarity, and includes the step of steeping and plumping the currants, which makes them much juicier.

### Ingredients

* `1/3 cup` currants
* `2 pounds` broccoli, about 1 large head
* `1/4 pound` red onion (1/2 small onion), finely chopped
* `3/4 cup` almonds, slivered or roughly chopped
* `1/2 cup` mayonnaise
* `2 tbsp` lemon juice
* `2 tbsp` rice vinegar
* `2 tbsp` sugar
* `1 tsp` salt
* Freshly ground pepper

### Directions

1. Heat 1/2 cup water to boiling and pour over the currants in a small bowl. Set aside for 5 minutes, then drain.
2. Shred the broccoli in a food processor, using the grater disk (the attachment with the holes, not the blade). In a large bowl, combine the shredded broccoli, currants, red onion, and almonds.
3. Whisk together the mayonnaise, lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, salt, and a generous quantity of fresh pepper. Pour the dressing over the broccoli mixture and stir to combine. Taste and add more salt or pepper, if needed. Allow to sit for 30 minutes (or an hour in the fridge) so the flavors can mingle.

### Notes

* **Quicker Slaw:** If you want to skip the broccoli shredding, substitute about `6 cups` of pre-shredded broccoli slaw mix for the whole broccoli.
* **Reader Tip:** Consider substituting dried cranberries for the currants.
