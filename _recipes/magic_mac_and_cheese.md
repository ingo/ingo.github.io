This Magic Mac and Cheese recipe is a result of a spring project to create the easiest, cheesiest, most satisfying macaroni and cheese recipe of all time. After testing every variable possible, the final product is a perfect blend of velvety cheese sauce, a beautifully browned panko topping, and a blend of cheeses balanced for ample flavor and melting power.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` cottage cheese, small curd, not fat-free
* `1/4 cup` sour cream
* `1` large egg
* `2 cups` milk (2% or whole milk)
* `1 tbsp` dried onion flakes
* `1 tsp` kosher salt
* `1 tsp` ground mustard
* `1 tsp` garlic powder
* `1/4 tsp` white pepper
* `1/8 tsp` cayenne pepper
* `2 tbsp` butter, divided
* `8 ounces` uncooked (dry) large elbow macaroni
* `1 cup` shredded cheddar cheese, plus more to top
* `1 cup` shredded mozzarella cheese, plus more to top
* `1 cup` shredded smoked gouda cheese, plus more to top
* `1 cup` shredded muenster cheese, plus more to top
* `1/3 cup` panko breadcrumbs
* Paprika or smoked paprika, as desired

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
2. In the bowl of a blender or food processor, combine the cottage cheese, sour cream, egg, milk, and seasonings and process until well-combined. If your food processor or blender are small, process the cottage cheese, sour cream, and egg first, then whisk in the other ingredients in a large bowl. Set aside and allow for any foam to settle.
3. Butter a small baking dish all over. Spread the uncooked macaroni in the dish. Pour the milk mixture over the macaroni and sprinkle the cheese on top. Mix well, cover with foil, and bake for 30 minutes.
4. Uncover the baking dish and stir until the melted cheese is well-incorporated. Melt the remaining butter and mix with the panko breadcrumbs.
5. Sprinkle the remaining cheese and the buttered breadcrumbs over the macaroni and cheese. Top with paprika. Continue to bake, uncovered, until browned on top, about 10-30 more minutes. For creamier macaroni, stick with a shorter baking time. For a denser, more casserole-like texture, bake up to 30 minutes more.
6. Let sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.

### Notes

- This recipe can be made ahead of time and refrigerated or frozen. It can also be customized with different cheeses, hot sauces, proteins, or other sauces. Adjust the baking time to achieve your desired texture, from ultra-creamy to more casserole-like.
