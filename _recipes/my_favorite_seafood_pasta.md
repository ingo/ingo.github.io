This recipe is a delightful cross-cultural fusion of Italian and Cajun cuisines. Inspired by Ruth Reichl’s Spaghetti allo Scoglio, it is cleverly adapted to make smart use of leftover broth from a Cajun seafood boil with garlic butter sauce. The pasta finishes directly in a small amount of the broth, absorbing concentrated shellfish flavor while staying rich and cohesive. 

### Ingredients

#### Broth Base
* Leftover `seafood boil broth` (strained), about `2-3 cups` total. Save the rest for another use.
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `2 cloves` garlic, smashed or minced
* `½ cup` dry white wine
* `20` cherry tomatoes, halved

#### Aromatics & Flavor
* `1/4 medium` onion, thinly sliced
* `1/2 small` carrot, peeled and finely chopped
* `2 tbsp` chopped parsley
* Black pepper, to taste

#### Pasta & Seafood
* `1 lb` spaghetti or linguine
* `¾–1 lb` shrimp, peeled and deveined
* `1 lb` mussels, scrubbed and debearded (optional)

#### Optional Finishers
* Extra parsley, chopped
* Lemon wedges

### Directions
1. Warm the leftover seafood boil broth in a small pot over low heat. Add the onion, carrot, and parsley and let it gently simmer for 10 minutes to re-open the aromatics. Strain and keep hot. You should have about 3–4 cups total.
2. In a wide, deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until just fragrant, about 30–60 seconds.
3. Pour in the white wine and let it reduce by about half.
4. Add the mussels, cover, and cook until they open, 2–3 minutes. Transfer opened mussels to a bowl and discard any that remain closed.
5. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until 2 minutes shy of al dente, then drain.
6. Add the cherry tomatoes to the skillet and cook just until they soften and release some juice.
7. Add about 1½ cups of the warm broth to the skillet, then add the drained pasta. Cook, tossing constantly, letting the pasta absorb the liquid.
8. Add the shrimp and cook until just pink, 1–2 minutes, adding more broth a splash at a time as needed. The sauce should cling to the pasta, not pool.
9. Return the mussels to the skillet along with any juices. Toss gently, add parsley and black pepper, and finish with a final splash of broth if needed.
10. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and extra parsley.

### Notes
* You will likely use 2 or so cups total, not the full amount — stop when the pasta is glossy and cohesive.
* Because the broth already contains butter and seasoning, additional salt is usually unnecessary.
* If the broth is very rich, a small splash of pasta water can lighten it without diluting flavor.
