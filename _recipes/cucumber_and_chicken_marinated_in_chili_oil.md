This Japanese dish is a delightful blend of cucumber and chicken marinated in chili oil. It's a simple, yet flavorful dish that can be served as a main course or a side dish. The recipe was adapted from Hashimoto's Tohoku Recipes and has been further refined by Nami from Just One Cookbook.

### Ingredients

* `6` Persian/Japanese cucumbers (6 cucumbers = 1.16 oz or 500 g or 2 English cucumbers)
* `3` chicken thighs with/without skin (3 thighs = 12.9 oz or 365 g)
* Korean Chili Thread (for garnish, optional)

#### Seasonings A:

* `¼ cup` water
* `2 tbsp` sake
* `1 tbsp` salt (kosher or sea salt; use half if using table salt)

### Directions

1. Gather all the ingredients.
2. Discard both ends of the cucumbers and peel the skin, leaving some part unpeeled for the look.
3. Cut the cucumbers in “rangiri” style, making long, thin diagonal cuts while rotating one-quarter between every cut.
4. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.
5. Place the chicken in a frying pan skin side down and add the Seasonings A.
6. Cover and start cooking over medium heat. Simmer for 2 minutes, then turn the chicken over and continue simmering covered for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.
7. Continue cooking with remaining heat and make sure the chicken is cooked through.
8. Combine Seasonings B in a large air tight container.
9. Remove the warm chicken from the pan and add in the container.
10. Add the cucumbers and mix well. Let marinate for at least 10 minutes. You can keep in refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Serve at cool or room temperature.

### Notes

This recipe is slightly adapted from Hashimoto's Tohoku Recipes. You can keep the marinated cucumber and chicken in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. Serve it at cool or room temperature.
