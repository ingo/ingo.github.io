This recipe comes from the renowned Spanish chef Penelope Casas. It's a staple in Spanish cuisine and is loved by both children and adults. While an omelet is a simple dish to prepare, it is important that you know the proper technique. When serving an omelet as a tapa, you should cut it into 1-inch squares that can be picked up with a toothpick. 

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` olive oil, for frying
* `4` large potatoes, peeled and cut into ⅛-inch slices
* `1` large onion, thinly sliced
* Kosher or sea salt, to taste
* `4` large eggs

### Directions

1. Heat the oil in an 8-inch or 9-inch skillet over medium heat until it sizzles when you drop in a potato slice. 
2. Add the potatoes and onion one slice at a time to prevent sticking, alternating layers of potatoes and onion. Season with salt. 
3. Cook, turning occasionally, until the potatoes are tender but not browned, for about 20 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon or spatula to a colander and let drain. Reserve 4 teaspoons oil and wipe out the skillet.
4. In a large bowl, beat the eggs lightly with a fork and add salt. Add the potatoes and press down until completely covered by the egg mixture. Let sit 15 minutes.
5. Heat 3 teaspoons of the reserved oil in the same skillet over high heat until it reaches the smoking point. Quickly pour in the potato-and-egg mixture and distribute evenly. 
6. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, shaking the skillet often to prevent sticking, until the bottom begins to brown. Slide the omelet onto a plate, cover with a second plate, and turn over.
7. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon reserved oil in the same skillet over high heat to the smoking point. Reduce the heat to medium and slide the omelet back into the skillet. 
8. Cook, shaking constantly until the bottom is browned, using the back of a pancake turner to neatly tuck in the edges. Continue cooking until the center is set but still slightly juicy within. Serve hot or at room temperature.

### Notes

- Substitute a sliced cauliflower for the potatoes
