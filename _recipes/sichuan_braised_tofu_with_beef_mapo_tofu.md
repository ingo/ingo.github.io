title: Sichuan Braised Tofu with Beef (Mapo Tofu)
---
This recipe is a classic Chinese dish that has been adapted to be more accessible for home cooks. The tofu is gently poached in chicken broth to help it stay intact during the braise, and the sauce is a flavorful blend of ginger, garlic, and Asian broad-bean chili paste.

### Ingredients

* `1 tbsp` Sichuan peppercorns 
* `12` scallions 
* `28 oz` soft tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* `2 cups` chicken broth
* `9` garlic cloves, peeled
* `1 (3-inch)` piece ginger, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch rounds
* `⅓ cup` Asian broad-bean chili paste 
* `1 tbsp` fermented black beans 
* `6 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `1 tbsp` Sichuan chili powder 
* `8 oz` 85 percent lean ground beef 
* `2 tbsp` hoisin sauce
* `2 tsp` toasted sesame oil 
* `2 tbsp` water 
* `1 tbsp` cornstarch 

### Directions

1. Place peppercorns in small bowl and microwave until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds. Let cool completely. Once cool, grind in spice grinder or mortar and pestle (you should have 1 1/2 teaspoons).
2. Using side of chef’s knife, lightly crush white parts of scallions, then cut scallions into 1-inch pieces. Place tofu, broth, and scallions in large bowl and microwave, covered, until steaming, 5 to 7 minutes. Let stand while preparing remaining ingredients.
3. Process garlic, ginger, chili paste, and black beans in food processor until coarse paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add 1/4 cup vegetable oil, chili powder, and 1 teaspoon peppercorns and continue to process until smooth paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer spice paste to bowl.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and beef in large saucepan over medium heat; cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until meat just begins to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef to bowl.
5. Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and spice paste to now-empty saucepan and cook, stirring frequently, until paste darkens and oil begins to separate from paste, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently pour tofu with broth into saucepan, followed by hoisin, sesame oil, and beef. Cook, stirring gently and frequently, until dish comes to simmer, 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk water and cornstarch together in small bowl. Add cornstarch mixture to saucepan and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer to serving dish, sprinkle with remaining peppercorns, and serve. (Mapo tofu can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)

### Notes

- Ground pork can be used in place of beef, if desired. Asian broad bean chili paste (or sauce) is also known as doubanjiang or toban djan; our favorite, Pixian, is available online. Lee Kum Kee Chili Bean Sauce is a good supermarket option. If you can’t find Sichuan chili powder, an equal amount of Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru) is a good substitute. In a pinch, use 2 1/2 teaspoons of ancho chile powder and ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper. If you can’t find fermented black beans, you can use an equal amount of fermented black bean paste or sauce or 2 additional teaspoons of Asian broad bean chili paste. Serve with steamed white rice.
