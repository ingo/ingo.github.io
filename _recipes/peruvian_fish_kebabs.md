This recipe for Peruvian Fish Kebabs comes from the Barbecue Bible by Steven Raichlen. It's a delightful mix of firm white fish and red bell peppers, marinated in a blend of garlic, cumin, vinegar, and lemon juice, then grilled to perfection. The unique addition of aji amarillo gives it a Peruvian twist that will make your barbecue stand out.

### Ingredients

* `1½ pounds` firm white fish, such as swordfish, halibut, or mahimahi (about 1 inch thick)
* Salt
* `2` red bell peppers, cored and seeded
* `6 cloves` garlic, peeled
* `1 teaspoon` ground cumin
* `⅓ cup` distilled white vinegar
* `⅓ cup` fresh lemon juice
* freshly ground black pepper
* `3 tablespoons` vegetable oil
* `1 tablespoon` aji amarillo powder or paste, ancho chile powder, or hot paprika
* `¼ teaspoon` ground turmeric (optional)
* Lemon wedges, for serving

### Special Equipment

* 4 long metal skewers

### Directions

1. Rinse the fish under cold running water, then drain it and blot dry with paper towels. Cut the fish into 1-inch cubes, place it in a medium-size nonreactive bowl, and toss it with 1½ teaspoons of salt. Let the fish stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the bell peppers into 1-inch squares and set aside.
2. Combine the garlic, cumin, vinegar, lemon juice, and ½ teaspoon of black pepper in a food processor or blender and process until blended and smooth. Pour this marinade over the fish and toss to coat. Let the fish marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
3. While the fish marinates, prepare the glaze. Heat the oil in a small skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the aji amarillo, turmeric (if using), and 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Gently cook the glaze, stirring with a wooden spoon, until red and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Set the glaze aside to cool.
4. Remove the fish cubes from the marinade and discard the marinade. Thread the fish cubes onto the skewers, alternating them with squares of bell pepper.
5. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to high.
6. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Arrange the kebabs on the hot grate and brush them with half of the glaze. Grill the kebabs, turning with tongs, until the fish cubes are nicely browned on the outside and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side (8 to 12 minutes in all). Brush the kebabs with the remaining glaze after turning.
7. Transfer the kebabs to serving plates or a platter and serve them at once with lemon wedges.
