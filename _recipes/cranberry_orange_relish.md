This holiday cranberry relish was the signature sauce Ingo's father served each Thanksgiving. The cranberries and orange are simply sweetened with sugar to create a chunky-style sauce that perfectly complements the turkey and stuffing. It's a classic recipe you'll want to add to your own holiday traditions.

### Ingredients

* `1` navel orange
* `1 (12-oz) bag` fresh cranberries
* `2/3 cup` sugar
* `2 tbsp.` Jack Daniels

### Directions

1. Finely grate 2 teaspoons zest from orange. Cut away and discard peel and pith from orange, then cut sections free from membranes.
2. Pulse cranberries with zest, orange sections, and sugar in a food processor until finely chopped. Add whiskey. 
3. Chill, covered, at least 2 hours to allow flavors to develop.

### Notes

- Active time: 10 min Start to finish: 2 1/4 hr.
