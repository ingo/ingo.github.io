title: Rice Pilaf With Pistachios And Raisins
---

We are still working on perfecting the balance of spices and dialing in the measurements.

### Ingredients

* `1/4 cup` finely chopped onion
* `1/4 tsp` turmeric
* `1/8 tsp` ground cardamom
* `1 1/2 tbsp` unsalted butter
* `1/3 cup` long-grain rice
* `2/3 cup` chicken broth
* `2 tbsp` pistachio nuts or pumpkin seeds, lightly toasted and chopped
* `2 tbsp` golden raisins, soaked in boiling water 1 minute and drained
* `2 tbsp` thinly sliced green scallions

### Directions

1. In a small heavy saucepan cook the onion with the turmeric and the cardamom in 1 tbsp. butter over low heat until the onion is softened.
2. Add rice and cook until coated with butter. Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, approximately 15 minutes.
3. Stir in the pistachios, raisins, scallions, remaining butter and salt and pepper to taste.
