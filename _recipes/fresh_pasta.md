We recently purchased a [Philips pasta machine](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-e/ho/cooking/pasta-maker.html) and some bronze pasta dies from [Pastidea](https://pastidea.com/en/). The dough will look like sand in the machine when mixing, but extrudes fine.

### Ingredients

* `200 g` semolina flour / durum flour
* `50 g` all purpose flour
* `90 g` water

### Directions

1. Add the desired pasta shape attachment to the pasta maker.
2. Add the flour to the Pasta Maker, ensuring it is evenly distributed. Gradually pour in the cold water, allowing the ingredients to combine evenly.
3. Set the Pasta Maker to knead the mixture thoroughly for a total of 6 minutes until the dough achieves a consistent texture.
4. Stop the machine, and let the dough rest for approximately 30 minutes to develop its elasticity.
5. Restart the machine and begin the extrusion process.
6. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil, and cook the freshly made pasta for 5-7 minutes until it reaches your desired level of tenderness. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
