title: Thai Coconut Soup (Khao Soi)
---
### Ingredients

* `4 ounces` dry rice noodles
* `1 tbsp` coconut or olive oil
* `2 tsp` ginger/garlic paste
* `1/2 tbsp` Thai yellow Curry Paste (store bought)
* `1 can` coconut milk (14oz)
* `1 3/4 cup` chicken broth (or use water and one chicken bouillon cube)
* `1` peeled and chopped eggplant
* `2 tbsp` fish sauce
* `2 tbsp` soy sauce
* `2 ½ tbsp` sugar, or alternative substitute
* `1` lime
* Garnish with fresh basil or cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions, or thinly sliced red onions.

### Directions

1. Place noodles in a shallow baking dish and boil enough water to just cover them.
2. In a medium pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic/ginger paste. Saute until fragrant and golden. Add curry paste. Fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the coconut milk and broth and bring to a simmer, stirring. Once gently simmering add the bell eggplant, soy, fish sauce, and sugar.
3. Simmer until the eggplant is soft. Give a generous squeeze of lime. Taste, adding more lime / or salt if necessary.
4. Drain the noodles. If serving the soup immediately, toss the noodles right into the pot and then serve.
5. Alternatively, divide noodles into the bowls and ladle the flavorful soup over top.
6. Garnish with fresh basil, bean sprouts, thinly sliced red onion and chopped scallions.

### Notes

To bump up the flavorful coconut broth even more, add a 4 inch piece of lemongrass (smashed) a few slices of galangal or a couple kefir lime leaves (all optional)

Feel free to make the soup the day before and keep in the fridge, keeping the noodles separate (they will swell in the soup) and simply reheat.
