description: "Kn\xF6del are a form of boiled bread, wonderful as an accompaniment\
  \ to a dish of chicken or beef with a creamy sauce. They are quite possibly one\
  \ of the things Ingo likes to eat most in this world. You'll want to start these\
  \ approximately 3 hours before serving, or about the same time you start your other\
  \ main course dishes if making on of the chicken or beef in sauce recipes found\
  \ elsewhere on Table M."

### Ingredients

* `3 cups` flour
* `1 package` active dry yeast
* `1` egg, beaten
* `1 cup` stale bread, chopped into ¼ in cubes
* `1 cup` lukewarm milk (100-110 degrees)
* `1 tsp` sugar

### Directions

1. Place flour in a large bowl, making an indent in the center. Mix together yeast, milk and sugar. Place in center of flour and let stand 10 minutes. Add egg and bread crumbs and mix until dough leaves the side of the bowl. It should be soft, but not too moist.
2. Let rest 10 minutes (if using active yeast), or let rise normally if using normal yeast.
3. Punch down (if necessary), and form into 8 balls. Place on cookie sheet, cover, and let rise until doubled in size.
4. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Place knödel, 4 at a time, into the salted water and let cook 15 minutes.
5. Remove from pot, drain and serve. Cut in half using a thread.
