### Ingredients

* `1/2 cup` cider vinegar
* `1/2 cup` loosely packed brown sugar
* `1/2 cup` white sugar
* `1/2 cup` sweet red pepper, peeled, seeded, diced 1/4 inch
* `1/2 cup` small white onion, peeled and diced
* `1` small red hot pepper, peeled, seeded and diced
* `1 tablespoon` finely chopped garlic
* `1 tablespoon` grated ginger
* `1/2 teaspoon` salt
* `1 1/2 pounds` firm, fresh peaches, blanched to remove the skin, pit removed, sliced into wedges

### Directions

1. Put the vinegar and the sugars into a non-reactive pot, place over medium heat and bring to a boil.
2. Add the red peppers, onion, garlic, ginger, salt and simmer 10 minutes.
3. Add the peach segments and simmer an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the peaches are of the desired softness.
4. If a thicker consistency is desired, strain out the solids from the liquid and boil the syrup until thickened. Re-add the peaches.
5. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Serve at room temperature.

### Notes

- If you'd like a little more heat, replace the smaller red pepper with a jalape√±o pepper.
