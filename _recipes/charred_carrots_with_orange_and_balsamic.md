title: Charred Carrots With Orange and Balsamic
---
Ina Garten made roasted whole carrots fashionable for home cooks with the publication of her first book, "The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook", in 1999. She has a signature style of brightening up basic dishes with lemon, orange and vinegar. This recipe, shared with The Times for Thanksgiving 2020, is from her book "Modern Comfort Food".

### Ingredients

* `1 ½ pounds` rainbow carrots, scrubbed (about 8 large or 15 medium carrots)
* `3 tablespoons` good-quality olive oil
* `1 ½ teaspoons` minced fresh thyme leaves
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* `½` orange, zested and juiced
* `1 tablespoon` syrupy, aged balsamic vinegar
* Fleur de sel or sea salt

### Directions

1. Position an oven rack 4 inches away from the broiler and heat the broiler.
2. Cut the carrots crosswise into 4-inch lengths. Cut the larger pieces lengthwise in half or quarters so the sticks are roughly 1/2-inch wide.
3. Place the carrots on a sheet pan and drizzle them with the olive oil. Sprinkle with the thyme, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Toss with your hands until coated, then spread the carrots out in an even layer.
4. Broil the carrots for about 10 minutes, tossing every few minutes, until they are tender and randomly charred. Top the carrots with the orange zest, orange juice and vinegar, sprinkle with some fleur de sel and toss to coat. Taste for seasonings, then serve warm or at room temperature.
