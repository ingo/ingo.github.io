title: Thai Coconut Pudding Cake Dessert
---

Served warm with a dollop of thick coconut milk or cream plus a sprinkling of toasted coconut, this tropical-tasting dessert is certain to please, especially if you're a coconut fan. Delicious and super easy to make, this pudding is healthy too - low in fat and sugar, plus gluten-free.

### Ingredients

* `1 can` good-quality coconut milk
* `2` eggs
* `Pinch` of salt
* `1/2 cup` rice flour (available at Asian/Chinese food stores in small plastic bags)
* `1 tsp` coconut extract
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract
* `1/4 cup` sugar (or more to taste)
* `4 dollops` of coconut cream (or thick coconut milk from the top of the can, whipped cream, or ice cream)
* `2 to 3 tbsp` toasted dry shredded coconut (see toasting instructions at end of recipe)

### Directions

1. Place 1 cup coconut milk in a mixing bowl. Crack in the eggs, and add a pinch of salt. Beat well with a fork or whisk until smooth (30 seconds to 1 minute).
2. Sprinkle the rice flour over and beat until smooth.
3. Add the extracts plus the sugar. Beat until smooth.
4. Taste-test the batter for sweetness, adding a little more sugar if desired.
5. Grease 4 ramekins (individual baking dishes) with a few drops of cooking oil (or you can use butter). Ladle the batter into these ramekins, filling to 3/4.
6. Place ramekins inside a long baking dish (the type you would use for lasagna). Pour some water into this dish so that it reaches 1/3 to 1/2 up the sides of the ramekins.
7. Place carefully in the oven. Bake at 375 F for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pudding/cakes are set. A fork inserted into the center should come out clean.
8. To Serve Pudding Cakes: Either leave them in the ramekins or loosen with a knife and remove by turning upside-down over serving plates. Add a dollop of the coconut cream (or whipped/ice cream) and a sprinkling of toasted coconut, if desired. Note that if you have refrigerated your coconut milk/cream, it will have hardened - not to worry, it will slowly "melt" over the warm pudding, making it delicious!
9. To Make Toasted Coconut: Simply "dry fry" (no oil) the coconut over medium heat, stirring continuously until the coconut turns golden brown and is fragrant. Remove coconut from the pan immediately, or it will continue toasting.
