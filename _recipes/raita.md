Raita is a versatile side dish from Indian Cuisine, made with yogurt, spices, herbs, vegetables and sometimes even with fruits. It's a celebrated hero among summer dishes, adding balance and flavor to an Indian meal. It's a coolant, a dip, and a serving sauce all in one.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` yogurt (more if required)
* `1` medium onion chopped
* `½ cup` cucumbers, peeled & chopped
* `¼ tsp` salt (adjust to taste)
* `1-2` green chilies deseeded & chopped
* `1-2 tbsp` cilantro leaves, chopped finely
* `½ tsp` cumin powder or roasted jeera (optional)

### Directions

1. Chill the yogurt. Rinse & chop the onions & green chilies. Rinse & peel the cucumbers. If needed deseed them & chop to bite sizes.
2. Rinse coriander leaves in ample amount of water. Drain completely and chop them fine.
3. Optional – Roast 1 tsp cumin seeds on a low flame until it smells good. Cool this and crush them to fine powder in a spice jar.
4. Add curd and salt to a mixing bowl. Whisk them until smooth with a fork or a whisk.
5. Next add chopped cucumbers, onions, cumin powder, cilantro leaves and green chilies.
6. Stir gently. If required add more yogurt. Taste test and add more salt if required.
7. Garnish with cumin powder on top. Serve raita with biryani, pulao, kebabs or paratha.

### Notes

- Ensure you use fresh ingredients whether it’s the curd or veggies and spices.
- Use store bought yogurt if you’re pressed for time, but raita made with homemade curd is another level of yum.
- Avoid sour yogurt as it will ruin the flavor profile, unless you’re a big fan of sour foods.
- Don’t add too much of spices. We want the basic tang of the yogurt to shine through. A little spice goes a long way.
