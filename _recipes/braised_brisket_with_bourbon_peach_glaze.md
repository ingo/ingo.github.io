title: Braised Brisket with Bourbon-Peach Glaze
category: Entrees 
description: No one will fault you for seasoning brisket with salt and pepper, braising it in beer, and calling it a day. But follow chef Lee's method—which calls for a bath of stout, bourbon, and soy sauce; a glaze made with peach jam; and a side of easy homemade pickles if you'd like—and you're on the path to savory-and-sweet nirvana.

### Ingredients

* Rub
  * `1 tbsp and 1 tsp` kosher salt
  * `1 tsp` freshly ground black pepper
  * `1/4 tsp` smoked paprika
  * `1/8 tsp` ground cinnamon
* Brisket
  * `1` 4-pound trimmed flat-cut brisket with about 1/3' top layer of fat
  * `2 tbsp` grapeseed oil, divided
  * `3/4 cup` chopped onion
  * `3` garlic cloves, smashed
  * `4 cups` beef broth
  * `1` 12-ounce bottle stout
  * `3/4 cup` bourbon
  * `1/4 cup` (packed) light brown sugar
  * `1/4 cup` soy sauce
  * `6` large sprigs thyme
  * `3` celery stalks, chopped
  * `2` plum tomatoes, cored, chopped
  * `1` large carrot, chopped
  * `1 tbsp` balsamic vinegar
* Glaze
  * `1/2 cup` peach jam or preserves
  * `2 tsp` bourbon
  * Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Directions

1. Mix all rub ingredients in a small bowl.
2. Rub brisket all over with spice rub. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before continuing.
3. Preheat oven to 325°. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large wide pot over high heat. Add brisket, fat side down. Cook undisturbed until well browned, 5–6 minutes. Turn brisket over and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a plate. Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add broth and all remaining ingredients. Bring liquid to a simmer. Return brisket to pot. Cover and transfer to oven.
4. Braise until brisket is very tender to the touch but still holds its shape, about 4 1/2 hours. Using a large spatula, transfer brisket, fat side up, to a large plate. Strain braising liquid into a large bowl. Return liquid to pot, bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Score fat side of brisket by cutting a cross-hatch pattern of 1/4"-deep slits spaced 1/2" apart. Return brisket, fat side up, to pot with reduced braising liquid.
5. Transfer 1/4 cup braising liquid to a blender. Add jam and bourbon and purée until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Preheat broiler. Spread 3–4 tablespoons glaze on top of brisket with the back of a spoon. Broil brisket in pot until browned and glazed, watching carefully to prevent burning, 4–5 minutes.
7. Transfer brisket to a cutting board. Slice against the grain and transfer to a large platter. Ladle braising liquid over. Drizzle remaining glaze on top.

### Notes

Brisket can be made 2 days ahead. Return brisket to pot, cover, and chill. Bring to a simmer and rewarm brisket before proceeding.
