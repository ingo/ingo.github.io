title: Labneh with Olives, Pistachios and Oregano
---

A hint of the Middle East in your kitchen. Try your hand at turning yogurt into a luxurious Middle Eastern cheese. This recipe may seem a bit technical, but it isn't really, providing you get started a day ahead. Serve the labneh with minimum graces: spoon inside chunks of good, crusty bread and top with tomato.

### Ingredients

* `450g` goat's yogurt (optional—can use regular yogurt)
* `450g` natural yogurt
* Coarse sea salt
* `20` green olives, pitted
* `1½ tbsp` roughly chopped fresh oregano
* `1 tbsp` chopped parsley
* Grated zest of `2` lemons
* `1` small garlic clove, crushed
* `100ml` olive oil
* `20g` pistachios, lightly toasted
* `20g` pine nuts or walnuts, lightly toasted
* `3` ripe tomatoes
* `½` a small red onion, thinly sliced

### Directions

1. Line a deep bowl with a coffee filter. In another bowl, stir the two yogurts and half a teaspoon of salt, pour into the filter, place in a sieve, and leave over a bowl for 24-36 hours. After this time, much of the liquid should have drained out and the remaining yogurt will turn thick and quite dry; the centre may still be creamy.

2. Remove the labneh from the cloth and transfer to a serving platter. Spread it over the plate with the back of a spoon, creating a loose, wavy pattern about 2cm thick.

3. Next, roughly chop the olives and put them in a bowl with the oregano, parsley, lemon zest, garlic and olive oil (reserving two tablespoons of the oil for the tomatoes). Use a pestle and mortar to crush the nuts roughly, leaving some just broken and others finely crushed. Stir into the olive mix, then spoon this over the labneh, leaving a border of about 2cm around the edge (if you want your labneh a bit milder, don't use the whole quantity), then sprinkle with chilli.

4. Finally, cut the tomatoes into thick wedges and mix with the sliced onion. Arrange on a side plate next to the labneh, sprinkle with salt and drizzle with the reserved olive oil. Serve the labneh and tomatoes with torn chunks of bread.
