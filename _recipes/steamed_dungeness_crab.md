Steaming Dungeness crabs is a culinary tradition in many coastal regions. The key to perfectly cooked crab is to steam it based on its weight, ensuring the meat is tender and sweet. This recipe provides a simple and effective method for steaming Dungeness crabs, along with a guide to steaming times based on crab weight.

### Ingredients
* Live Dungeness crabs (any size)
* `1–2 inches` water (or water + beer/white wine, optional)
* `2–3 tbsp` kosher salt
* Optional aromatics: lemon halves, bay leaves, Old Bay

### Directions
1. Add `1–2 inches` of liquid to a large pot.
2. Add salt and optional aromatics.
3. Insert a steamer basket and bring the liquid to a rolling boil.
4. Add live crabs using tongs, cover the pot tightly.
5. Start timing once strong steam is established, not when crabs go in. Steam according to the weight table below.
6. Crabs are done when shells are bright orange, legs pull away easily, and meat is opaque and aromatic.
7. Transfer crabs to an ice bath for `2–3 minutes`, then drain.
8. To serve, remove the top shell, discard gills and viscera, and crack the crab. Serve with butter and lemon.

### Notes
* Dungeness crabs vary widely in density. Overcooking by even 2–3 minutes can dry out the leg meat. Steaming by weight preserves sweetness and tenderness.
* Rule of thumb: ~7 minutes per pound, measured after the pot returns to a strong steam.
* Steaming time by crab weight (Whole Crabs):
  <table>
    <tr><th>Weight</th><th>Steaming Time</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1.25–1.5 lb</td><td>12–14 minutes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1.75–2.0 lb</td><td>15–17 minutes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2.25–2.5 lb</td><td>18–20 minutes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2.75–3.0 lb</td><td>20–22 minutes</td></tr>
  </table>
* If crabs are cleaned or halved, reduce steaming time by 30–35%:
  <table>
    <tr><th>Weight</th><th>Steaming Time</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1.5–2.0 lb</td><td>10–12 minutes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2.25–2.5 lb</td><td>13–14 minutes</td></tr>
  </table>
