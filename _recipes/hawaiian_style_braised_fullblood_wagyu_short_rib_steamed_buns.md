---

This recipe is a delightful fusion of Hawaiian and Asian cuisines, featuring tender short ribs braised in a flavorful mix of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and pineapple, all wrapped up in a soft, homemade steamed bun.

### Ingredients

* `2 lbs` Beef Short Ribs
* `2 cups` Beef Stock
* `1 cup` Low Sodium Soy Sauce
* `1/2 cup` Rice Wine Vinegar
* `1/2 cup` Brown Sugar
* `1/2 cup` Mirin
* `1 tbsp` Minced Ginger Root
* `1 tbsp` Minced Garlic
* `1 cup` Crushed Pineapple
* `2 cups` All Purpose Flour
* `1/2 cup` Sugar
* `1 tbsp` Instant Yeast
* `1 tsp` Kosher Salt
* `1/2 cup` Milk
* `1/4 cup` Grapeseed Oil
* `1/4 cup` Rice Vinegar
* `1/4 cup` Water
* `1 tsp` Baking Powder

### Directions

1. Pull the beef short ribs from the freezer, and place them in the refrigerator 24 hours before starting this recipe.
2. Season the cut Fullblood Wagyu short ribs with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a large stainless steel sauté pan on medium-high heat. Add enough grapeseed oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Once the pan and oil are hot, add 4-5 pieces of the cut and seasoned short ribs. Sear the beef on both sides for 2-3 minutes per side. The goal is to achieve a nice caramelization and crust. Remove the short ribs from the pan, and place them in a crock pot. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of beef stock, while scraping up any bits left behind. Reduce the beef stock by half, and then add it to the crock pot. Return the pan to medium-high heat, and repeat the above steps until all of the short ribs are seared and in the crock pot.
3. Once all of the short ribs are in the crock pot, turn it on low. Add in the remaining beef stock (1 1/2 cups), low sodium soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, mirin, minced ginger root, minced garlic, and crushed pineapple. Cook on low for 8 hours. Remove the Fullblood Wagyu short ribs from the crock pot, and place them in a bowl. Shred the beef with two forks. Put the juices from the crock pot in a large pot on the stove. Reduce the liquid down to 1 1/2 cups. Once the liquid is reduced, mix it into the bowl with the shredded Fullblood Wagyu short ribs.
4. Mix together the all purpose flour, sugar, instant yeast, and kosher salt in a large bowl. Add in the milk, grapeseed oil, rice vinegar, and water. Mix into a dough, adding a little extra water if needed. Mix in a stand mixer with a dough hook for 5 minutes or until smooth. Then, cover with a damp cloth, and leave the dough to rise for 2 hours or until doubled in size.
5. Tip the dough out onto a clean work surface, and punch it down. Flatten the dough with your hands, then sprinkle 1 teaspoon of baking powder over it. Knead for 5 minutes. Using a bench knife and kitchen scale, cut the dough and weigh it out to 1.7 ounce pieces. You should have 18 dough pieces total. In the palm of your hand, roll each dough piece into a round ball. Leave them to rest for 2-3 minutes.
6. Using a rolling pin, roll out each dough ball, one by one, into an oval shape (about 3-4 mm thick). Rub the surface of the dough ovals with grapeseed oil. Then, brush a little oil over a chopstick. Place the oiled chopstick in the center of each oval. Fold the dough over the chopstick. Then, slowly pull out the chopstick. Cut 18 squares of baking parchment, and put a bun on each piece of parchment paper. Transfer the 18 buns to a baking tray. Cover with a clean tea towel or lightly oiled cling film. Leave in a warm place for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.
7. Heat a large bamboo steamer over a medium-high heat. Steam the buns for 8 minutes until puffed up (you’ll need to do this in batches). Once steamed, open each bun and fill it with our Hawaiian style braised Fullblood Wagyu short ribs and pickled vegetables. Eat the steamed buns while they’re still warm. Enjoy!
