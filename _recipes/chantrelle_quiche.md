This recipe is a combination of multiple individual recipes, taking inspiration from Alison Roman's high-sided quiche and Cook's Illustrated quiche recipe.

### Ingredients

* All-purpose flour, for dusting
* `1` disc pie crust
* `1 lb` chantrelles, cleaned and trimmed, roughly chopped
* `1` large shallot, thinly sliced
* `2 tbsp` butter
* `1 oz` shredded raclette or gruyère cheese
* `5 oz` shredded mozzerella
* `2` large eggs
* `2` large egg yolks
* `1 cup` whole milk
* `1 cup` heavy cream
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* white pepper, to taste

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a round about 14 inches in diameter.
3. Transfer the dough round to a 9-inch springform or regular cake pan (line with parchment if using a regular cake pan), pressing into the bottom and up the sides about 2 inches. Using a knife or scissors, trim any overhang.
4. Place a sheet of parchment paper inside the dough and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the sides are set and the top is starting to brown, 20–25 minutes. Remove it from the oven and remove the pie weights and parchment. Return the crust to the oven to continue to brown on the bottom, another 5 minutes or so.
5. Meanwhile, melt the butter in the skillet.
6. Sautee the chantelles and the shallots with a pinch of salt until the mushrooms release their iquid and are dry and starting to brown.
7. Once the crust is baked, remove it from the oven and set it aside while you prepare the filling. U
8. In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, and heavy cream together until well blended. Season with salt and pepper.
9. Shread the cheese over the bottom of thge shell, and top with the mushroom filling. Pour the mixture into the prebaked quiche shell.
10. Bake until the custard is set and no longer jiggles, 40–45 minutes, or a final temperature of 175°F as measured with a thermometer placed 1" from the rim of the quiche. It should look slightly puffed and browned around the edges, but still pretty blond in the center.
