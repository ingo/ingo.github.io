 This version is lighter, delicious on its own with whipped cream or butter and maple syrup. But layered with slices of luscious mango and rich Orange-Blossom Clotted Cream, they are out of this world.
 
### Ingredients

* `3` egg yolks
* `Â½ cup` sugar
* `2 cups` self-raising flour
* `1` zest of orange, finely chopped
* `2 drops` vanilla essence
* `1 cup` milk
* `3` egg whites
* `2` mangoes, cheeks sliced off, peeled, and cut into thick slices
* Orange-Blossom Clotted Cream

### Directions

1. Whisk the egg yolks with half the sugar. Mix in the flour, orange zest, and vanilla, and then add the milk slowly, ensuring there are no lumps. The batter should be like a thick pouring cream.
2. Whip the egg whites with the remaining sugar until they form soft peaks, and carefully fold them into the batter. Fry spoonfuls of batter in a nonstick pan.
3. Fold the pancakes over and stuff with a generous dollop of Orange-Blossom Clotted Cream and a few slices of mango. Drizzle with a little caramel or maple syrup, or a little dried-lime sugar syrup, and eat straightaway.

### Notes

- The pancakes can be bought ready-made from the bakery and stuffed with Arab clotted cream (eishta), chopped pistachios, and rose-petal jam, and drizzled with syrup for a traditional Middle Eastern version.
- The pancakes are also delicious on their own with whipped cream or butter and maple syrup.
