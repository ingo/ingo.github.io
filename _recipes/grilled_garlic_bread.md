This grilled garlic bread is a quick and easy side for summer dinners. It's hot, smoky, and friendly to a juicy steak, a whole fish, or a Caprese salad. Any loaf that is not too thick can be used, but whole grain stands up better to the oil-garlic-fire treatment. You may doubt that using garlic cloves with the papery skins on will work, but the rough surface of the toasted bread rubs them right off.

### Ingredients

* 1 large (or 2 small loaves) baguette or ciabatta bread, preferably whole grain 
* Olive oil 
* `2` garlic cloves, not peeled 
* `1` large ripe tomato, halved (optional) 
* Coarse salt such as kosher or Maldon 

### Directions

1. Cut bread in half lengthwise, and cut in half crosswise if very long. Brush cut surfaces of bread lightly with olive oil. Under a broiler or on a grill, toast bread, turning a few times, until cut surfaces are golden brown. (If using a broiler, you can place bread directly on the oven rack.)
2. Remove bread to a work surface, grab a garlic clove with your fingertips and rub it lightly over the cut surfaces of the bread. (The papery skin of the garlic will come off.) When the bread is well scented with garlic, brush again with olive oil and toast again. If using tomato, rub the cut surfaces against the bread so the bread absorbs the juice. Oil and toast bread one last time, until golden and charred. Sprinkle lightly with salt and serve immediately.
