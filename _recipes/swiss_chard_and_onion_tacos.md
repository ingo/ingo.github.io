This flavorful plant-based option is perfect for a party menu, as it's hearty and satisfying enough for omnivores too. It'll make them feel like they're being all good and healthy while still enjoying tasty tacos. This recipe is a lifesaver when you're throwing a party and suddenly remember that one friend who's a vegetarian. But don't worry, this taco is so good that even the omnivores in your life will love it. It's a recipe adapted from Chef Rick Bayless' cookbook, Mexican Everyday.

### Ingredients

* `1 bunch` Swiss chard
* `1 and 1/2 tablespoons` vegetable oil or olive oil
* `1` large onion, sliced
* `3` garlic cloves, minced
* Pinch red pepper flakes
* `1/2 cup` vegetable broth, chicken broth, or water
* Kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Corn Tortillas
* Queso Fresco, crumbled
* Roasted Tomatillo Salsa

### Directions

1. Remove thick stems from Swiss chard and tear into bite-size pieces.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and cook until golden brown but still has some crunch to it, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic, red pepper flakes, and a big pinch of Kosher salt, and cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently.
3. Add broth or water and the Swiss chard. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pan (if you donâ€™t have a lid, you can just use a baking sheet), and cook for approximately 5 minutes. Uncover the skillet, raise the heat back to medium-high, and cook until the water/broth is evaporated, stirring occasionally. Taste and season with additional Kosher salt if needed.
4. Warm corn tortillas by wrapping in a slightly damp kitchen towel and microwaving on half power. Top warm corn tortillas with a bit of the Swiss chard and onion mixture, a dollop of the roasted tomatillo salsa, and sprinkle with queso fresco.

### Notes

- You can substitute Swiss chard with collard, mustard, or beet greens, or even spinach. If you have leftovers, add the Swiss chard and onion mixture to some scrambled eggs the next morning for a killer breakfast taco.
