Fesenjan is a classic preparation in Persian cooking. Chicken pieces are first browned and then slowly cooked in a sauce with ground toasted walnuts and pomegranate molasses. The toasted walnuts are rich and warm and the pomegranate molasses sharp and berry toned. Cooked slowly with the chicken, the sauce is spectacular.
