description: "Inspired by the Italian dish of saut\xE9ed puntarelle and white beans,\
  \ this recipe makes a satisfying vegetarian main course or a hearty side dish for\
  \ roast chicken or sausages. It opts for canned white beans, for the sake of weeknight\
  \ convenience, and Swiss chard, which is much milder than puntarelle and easier\
  \ to find in the U.S. Kale or escarole would also work well, if that\u2019s what\
  \ you\u2019ve got. On that note, grated Pecorino Romano cheese gives the broth a\
  \ more pungent element, but Parmesan will work in its place. Serve in shallow bowls\
  \ with toasted country bread to mop up the garlicky broth."

### Ingredients

* `¼ cup` olive oil
* `1` small fennel bulb, trimmed, cored and small-diced
* `1` small yellow onion, small-diced
* `2 tsp` minced fresh rosemary or thyme
* `5` garlic cloves, minced
* `¼ tsp` red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste
* `1 large or 2 small` bunches escarole, kale or Swiss chard, stems removed (10 to 12 ounces)
* `2 (15-ounce)` cans cannellini beans, rinsed
* `2 cups` low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* `1 tbsp` lemon juice
* `½ cup` shredded mozzarella (optional)
* `3 tbsp` grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan, plus more for serving
* Toasted country bread, for serving

### Directions

1. In a 12-inch skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium. Add the fennel, onion and rosemary, and cook for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Add the garlic and red-pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Begin adding handfuls of the greens, cooking and stirring until leaves wilt.
3. Add the white beans, broth and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer, mashing some of the beans with a wooden spoon, until the liquid has reduced and thickened, 6 to 8 minutes.
4. Off the heat, stir in the lemon juice, then the mozzarella, if using, and Pecorino Romano. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Divide among shallow bowls and top with more Pecorino Romano. Serve with toasted bread and a dish of red-pepper flakes on the side.
