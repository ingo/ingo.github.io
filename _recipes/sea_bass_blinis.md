This recipe is a creative take on the classic blinis, featuring sea bass as the star ingredient. It was created by Robert Thompson, a chef known for his characterful and classically skilled cooking.

### Ingredients

#### Sea bass

* `1` wild sea bass fillet, weighing 600g, scaled and pin-boned
* `1` lemon, zested
* `1 tsp` black peppercorns, crushed
* `1 tbsp` of chervil, chopped
* `1` lime, zested
* `1` orange, zested
* `100g` of brown sugar
* `100g` of sea salt

#### Blinis

* `3 tbsp` of ossetra caviar
* `3 tbsp` of crème fraîche
* `12` sprigs of chervil
* `12` blinis
* `1 tbsp` of olive oil

### Directions

1. Combine the salt, sugar, zests, pepper and chervil, mixing well.
2. Using the zest mix, make a thin layer the same shape as the fish on a plastic tray, then place the fillet skin-side up on the salt and pack the remaining salt on top. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours.
3. Remove as much of the salt mixture from the fish as possible and then rinse very well under cold water. Pat the fish dry and then put skin-side down on a board.
4. Remove the skin by sliding a sharp, flexible knife blade between the skin and flesh.
5. Slice the fillet crossways as thinly as possible; you need 3-4 slices per blini. Dress with a little olive oil.
6. To plate put 3-4 slices of the seabass on each blini, add a little crème fraiche and then finish with the osetra caviar and a little chervil.

### Notes

- Remember to remove as much of the salt mixture from the fish as possible before rinsing to ensure the perfect balance of flavors.
