### Backstory
The "Peter Principle" cocktail originated in a quaint Parisian bar, where a cultural mix-up led to its accidental creation. The name and the drink were inspired by a customer named Peter, who, in search of a classic Gin Martini, found himself at the mercy of local bartenders unfamiliar with the cocktail. Instead, they served him a drink mixed with Martini-brand vermouth, mistaking the brand for the cocktail.

As the story goes, the bartenders, while skilled in the art of French aperitifs, were comically unfamiliar with the nuances of international cocktails. This led to the creation of a drink that Peter ironically named the "Peter Principle," a nod to the adage about rising to one's level of incompetence. The bartenders, in their attempt to create a Gin Martini, had inadvertently crafted a unique and delightful cocktail, embodying the essence of the Peter Principle.

Despite the initial mix-up, the cocktail was an instant hit. Its blend of gin with both sweet and dry Martini vermouths, garnished with a twist of lime, struck a perfect balance between the familiar and the novel. The "Peter Principle" thus became a testament to happy accidents and the unforeseen beauty of embracing one's limitations.

6. **Garnish and Aroma:** Garnish with the lime twist, releasing its essential oils over the glass before adding it to the drink.
