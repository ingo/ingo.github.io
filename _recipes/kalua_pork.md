This recipe is a treasured family recipe of Jess Larson. The Best-Ever Kalua Pig is succulent, fall-apart tender pulled pork shoulder infused with rich earthy & smoky flavor. Kalua pork is pure Hawaiian goodness, perfect for traditional kalua pork & cabbage, pulled pork sandwiches & sliders, tacos, nachos, & more. Oven, slow cooker & electric pressure cooker instructions provided.

### Ingredients

* `2.5–3 pounds` boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3–4 large pieces
* `8–10 cloves` garlic, sliced in half lengthwise
* `2 tablespoons` olive oil
* `1 large` banana leaf, thawed if frozen & cut into 3 smaller pieces
* `2 tablespoons` Hawaiian sea salt
* `1 1/2 tablespoons` liquid smoke, divided
* `2 cups` water or chicken stock

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F, ensuring a rack is positioned in the center of the oven.
2. Stud the pork with garlic: Using a sharp paring knife, carefully cut a few deep slits into each piece of pork shoulder, then insert sliced garlic into each pocket.
3. Sear the pork: Add the olive oil to a large, heavy-bottomed pot with a lid over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot & shimmering, carefully add in the prepared pork. Work in batches, as necessary, to avoid overcrowding the pot (which prevents browning). Cook for 4-5 minutes per side, until nicely browned. Transfer the browned pork to a plate, remove the pot from the heat & set aside to cool.
4. Wrap the pork in banana leaves: Place the seared pork in the center of one of the pieces of banana leaf. Season with the Hawaiian sea salt & 1 tablespoon of the liquid smoke, using your hands to rub the salt & liquid smoke all over the surface of the pork. Arranged the seasoned pork in a small pile at the center of the banana leaf, folding the corners & edges of the banana leaf into the center to encase the pork. Carefully flip & set the wrapped pork seam side down on the second section of banana leaf. Repeat folding with the remaining pieces of banana leaf.
5. Braise the kalua pig: Carefully set the banana leaf-wrapped pork seam side down in the pot used to sear the pork. Pour the water or chicken stock around the sides of the banana leaf-wrapped pork. Cover the pot & transfer the pot to the oven. Cook for 2 1/2 – 3 hours, until the kalua pork is fall-apart tender.
6. Finish the kalua pork: Carefully transfer the pork to a plate or cutting board. Use tongs or 2 forks to shred the pork into bite-sized pieces. Once shredded, transfer to a large mixing bowl. Season with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon liquid smoke & a few spoonfuls of the cooking liquid in the pot as desired, stirring to combine.

### Notes

- Banana leaf is absolutely crucial in this kalua pork recipe, as it perfumes the pork with a rich, earthy flavor. You can find banana leaf sold in the freezer section of most well-stocked Asian grocery stores.
- Hawaiian sea salt is also crucial in this kalua pig recipe. It’s richer in minerals than conventional salt (& it’s as authentic as it gets!). Yes, you need 2 full tablespoons for this recipe – Hawaiian sea salt is very coarse (so there are fewer crystals per tablespoon) & it’s notably less salty than conventional salt.
- Make-Ahead, Storage & Freezing: Kalua pulled pork stores incredibly well! Transfer cooled kalua pork to an airtight container & store in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. Easily reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave. Kalua pulled pork is also incredibly freezer-friendly. To freeze, transfer cooled kalua pork to a freezer container (or divide it up between multiple freezer containers for smaller portions). Freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, place the frozen kalua pig in the refrigerator overnight or submerge the freezer container in room temperature water for a quicker thaw. Easily reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave.
- Alternate cooking methods: SLOW COOKER KALUA PORK and ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER KALUA PORK instructions are provided in the original recipe.
