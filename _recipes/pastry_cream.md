The combination of egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and milk creates a thick and creamy base, while the addition of vanilla extract and Cognac gives it a unique and delightful flavor. The final touch of Greek yogurt makes this dessert irresistibly creamy and delicious.

### Ingredients

* `5` extra-large egg yolks, room temperature
* `3/4 cup` sugar
* `3 tbsp` cornstarch
* `1 1/2 cups` scalded milk
* `1/2 tsp` pure vanilla extract
* `1 tsp` Cognac
* Greek Yogurt

### Directions

1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the egg yolks and sugar on medium-high speed for 4 minutes, or until very thick. Reduce to low speed, and add the cornstarch.
2. With the mixer still on low, slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture. Pour the mixture into a medium saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. Don't be alarmed when the custard comes to a boil and appears to curdle; switch to a whisk and beat vigorously. Cook, whisking constantly, for another 2 minutes; the custard will come together and become very thick, like pudding.
4. Stir in the vanilla, Cognac. Pour the custard through a sieve into a bowl. Place plastic wrap directly on the custard and refrigerate until cold. Fold in the yogurt.
