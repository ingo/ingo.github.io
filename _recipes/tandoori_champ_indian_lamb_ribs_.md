title: Tandoori Champ (Indian Lamb Ribs)
---
In India, these ribs would be cooked in a tandoor, a clay oven. To achieve a similar oven-roasted effect on a charcoal or gas grill, cook the ribs over indirect heat, then finish them with a sear directly over the fire.

### Ingredients

* `2 racks` lamb spareribs (often called Denver ribs)
* `1 tbsp` cumin seeds
* `1 tbsp` garam masala
* `8 cloves` garlic, peeled
* `1` (4″-piece) ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
* `½ cup` whole-milk Greek yogurt
* `¼ cup` malt vinegar
* `3 tsp` cayenne pepper
* `2 tsp` ground cardamom
* `1 ½ tsp` red food coloring
* `1 tsp` freshly grated nutmeg
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* Juice of `1` lemon, plus wedges for serving
* Melted unsalted butter, for serving

### Directions

1. Place ribs in a roasting pan. Heat cumin seeds and garam masala in an 8″ skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds; let cool. Transfer to a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder. Purée garlic and ginger in a food processor until very smooth. Add the cumin and garam masala powder, plus yogurt, vinegar, cayenne, cardamom, food coloring, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and lemon juice; purée until smooth; rub mixture over ribs. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
2. Heat a charcoal grill or set a gas grill to high; bank coals or turn off burner on one side. Grill ribs, flipping once, until slightly charred and tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. If the outside starts to burn before the ribs are fully cooked, move them to the cooler section of the grill and continue to cook until tender. Rest ribs 20 minutes; slice into individual ribs. Serve with lemon wedges and melted butter.
