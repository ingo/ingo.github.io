### Ingredients

* `2 quarts` of Chicken Soup
* `2` Large Spoons of Coriander Powder
* `1 tbsp` of Rice Powder as No. 48, and Pinch of Pepper
* `1 pint` of good Milk
* `2` Large Onions, sliced
* `1` Piece of Ginger
* `1` Garlic, small one
* `½ tsp` of Cumin Powder
* `1` Dessertspoon Butter

### Directions

1. Let these simmer for ten minutes, now strain it through a muslin or gravy strainer.
2. When the onions are browned add the mollagoo tanney with a small bay leaf, and skim off the grease, and send to table in a soup tureen as a soup; but this should be used instead of soup, or the first dish for a lunch or breakfast or dinner, but I recommend for dinner in Europe.
3. Cut lemon should be handed round with the above and plain boiled rice. Fried red herring wouldn't be a bad accompaniment. In India the mullagatawny is used generally once a week—say on a Sunday or Wednesday.
4. The natives usually have this mullagatawny on Fridays after their caste. Some mullagatawny are made of plain Curry stuffs, tamarind, etc., not worth for Europeans.
5. The Curry stuffs you use for mollagoo tanney should be very fine. Take a large stew-pan and mix all the above together, only one onion (sliced), garlic and ginger chopped up fine. Let these simmer for ten minutes, now strain it through a muslin or gravy strainer. Now fry the other onion in the dessertspoon of butter in another stew-pan.

### Notes

Tips: Some parties who visited India like native mullagatawny better than the above, according to taste, but I recommend the above for Europeans. The cayenne pepper should be added if required hot. The above plan of chutney is suitable for cold meats, Curries, etc. In Ceylon, Mango Chutney is made in similar way, but they use tamarind, and when grinding use vinegar to soften the ingredients when grinding. In Ceylon every cook would send a samball to table with the Curry and rice; also native meals are never without a samball—especially samball, or some ball. It is only a new-made chutney or pickle, but fresh made, called _sampball_.
