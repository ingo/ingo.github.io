Sakura Maru was the name of the ship that brought the first Japanese immigrants to Peru. This dish is a nod to their rich culture and that important moment when they arrived on Peruvian shores. It's a fusion of Peruvian and Japanese cuisine, featuring thinly sliced salmon, fresh vegetables, and a tangy Tiger's Milk marinade.

### Ingredients

* Vegetable oil, for frying
* `A small handful` of rice vermicelli (be careful not to break them)
* `2` green onions
* `1/2` red onion, finely chopped
* `1` large tomato, seeded and finely chopped
* `2 tbsp` finely chopped cilantro leaves
* `14 oz/400 g` salmon fillets, skinned and trimmed
* `1 portion` Nikkei Tiger's Milk
* Fine sea salt

### Directions

1. Half fill a saucepan with vegetable oil and heat until smoking. Add the vermicelli and cook for just 10 seconds. The noodles will immediately start to puff up and turn opaque. Remove immediately and drain on paper towels.
2. Cut the white portion and half of the green portion of the green onions on the diagonal into 3/4-inch / 2-cm pieces.
3. Mix the red onion, tomato, and cilantro together in a bowl.
4. Cut the fish into slices on the diagonal across the grain as thinly as possible. You should end up with slices that look similar to shop-bought smoked salmon.
5. Arrange the salmon slices on plates. Pour some tiger's milk on each of them and add a little salt to flavor if needed.
6. Add some onion and tomato mix on top of the salmon and green onions around it. Finish each plate by putting some of the puffed vermicelli on top of the onions to give the dish some height and crunchiness.

### Notes

- You can make a larger batch of the fried vermicelli if you like, as they keep well in an airtight container.
- Nikkei cuisine is rooted in a respect for the foods of both Peru and Japan. They have much in common, not the least of which is a reverence for the freshest fish and seafood. The result of this collaboration is a seamless fusion of delicious foods and dishes that are among the most popular in Peru.
