description: A versatile 'mother' sauce traditionally used for beef in Korean cuisine.
  At Chan Seattle, we do a fairly traditional preparation of bulgogi sauce but with
  a few tweaks. One is using Coca-Cola in our sauce to help tenderize the meat and
  bring some acidity to the dish.

* `1/2` Onion - Chopped
* `12 cloves` Garlic, peeled

* `1/3 c` Sesame oil

### Directions

### Notes

This sauce is terrific for a slow braise using bone in, three pounds of beef short ribs cut 3" wide in a Dutch oven.

#### Cooking Instructions:

1. Brown the short ribs over medium high heat in the Dutch oven with a tablespoon of oil. Reserve the short ribs on a plate.
2. Add a one onion and two carrots - diced and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent - about 5 minutes. Reserve in a bowl.
3. Deglaze the pan with sake.
4. Place short ribs, carrots and onion back in the Dutch oven and fill half way up with bulgogi sauce.
5. Cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
6. Drop in 2 dried Thai chilis prior to service (if you want a bit of a kick!)

This dish is typically served with steamed rice.
