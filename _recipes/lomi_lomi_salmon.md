A must-have for any proper Hawaiian meal or luau. Lomi Lomi Salmon is a Hawaiian side dish made from salted salmon, tomatoes, onions, and green onions.

### Ingredients

* `1/2 pound` salted salmon (if you can't find salted salmon, make your own!)
* `2` medium tomatoes
* `1` large sweet onion
* `6 stalks` green onion

### Directions

Lomi lomi:

1. Dice all the ingredients (salted salmon, tomatoes, onions, and green onions) separately. You want small, bite-sized pieces, think pencil eraser size.
2. Put it all together into a big bowl.
3. _Lomi_ aka gently knead the ingredients together until well mixed. There is no need to salt or season because the salmon is already salted.
4. Eat and enjoy!

Salted salmon:
1. Get a nice half-pound salmon filet. Clean and pat dry.
2. Cover _both_ sides of the salmon with Hawaiian sea salt.
3. Put the salted salmon in a shallow bowl and wrap with plastic.
4. Refrigerate for three days (youâ€™re curing the salmon). And _tadah_, salted salmon.
5. Before using it to make lomi lomi salmon: wash the salmon and soak in a bowl of cold water for an hour. Then pat dry, and chop away.

### Notes

- In Hawaiian, _lomi lomi_ means _to knead or massage._ _Lomi lomi salmon_ is salted salmon that is gently kneaded aka mixed together with other ingredients (tomatoes, onions, and green onions).
- Regarding the onions: if you can find sweet Maui onions, definitely use that (I know it's hard to find outside of Hawaii).
