Lomi Lomi Salmon is a Hawaiian side dish made from salted salmon, tomatoes, onions, and green onions. It's a must-have for any Hawaiian meal or luau. Here's everything you need to know about Lomi Lomi Salmon, plus a step-by-step photo recipe!

### Ingredients

* `1/2 pound` salted salmon
* `2` medium tomatoes
* `1` large sweet onion
* `6 stalks` green onion

### Directions

1. Dice all the ingredients (salted salmon, tomatoes, onions, and green onions) separately. You want small, bite-sized pieces, think pencil eraser size.
2. Put it all together into a big bowl.
3. _Lomi_ aka gently knead the ingredients together until well mixed. There is no need to salt or season because the salmon is already salted.
4. Eat and enjoy!

### Notes

- In Hawaiian, _lomi lomi_ means _to knead or massage._ _Lomi lomi salmon_ is salted salmon that is gently kneaded aka mixed together with other ingredients (tomatoes, onions, and green onions).

Regarding the onions: if you can find sweet Maui onions, definitely use that (I know it's hard to find outside of Hawaii).

If you can't find salted salmon, make your own:

- Get a nice half-pound salmon filet. Clean and pat dry.
- Cover _both_ sides of the salmon with Hawaiian sea salt.
- Put the salted salmon in a shallow bowl and wrap with plastic.
- Refrigerate for three days (youâ€™re curing the salmon). And _tadah_, salted salmon.
- Before using it to make lomi lomi salmon: wash the salmon and soak in a bowl of cold water for an hour. Then pat dry, and chop away.
