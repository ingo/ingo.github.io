This Fennel and Pea Soup is a delicately flavored dish that serves as a perfect prelude to a hearty salad for lunch, or a simple grilled or broiled fish for dinner. The combination of fennel and peas brings a unique taste and aroma that is both comforting and invigorating.

### Ingredients
* `4 tbsp` unsalted butter
* `1` medium onion, cut into ½-inch dice (about `1 cup`)
* `1` medium fennel bulb, fronds removed, cored, and cut into ¼-inch dice
* `1` bay leaf
* `½ tsp` dried thyme
* `¼ tsp` dried rosemary
* `4 cups` chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth
* `1 lb` frozen peas (about `3½ cups`), partially thawed at room temperature for 15 minutes
* `15` fresh basil leaves, washed and dried
* Salt and ground black pepper, to taste
* `1 tsp` olive oil

### Directions
1. Melt the butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat until the foaming subsides. Add the onion and fennel, cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until translucent, about 15 minutes.
2. Add the bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, and chicken stock. Increase the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the fennel is soft, about 15 minutes.
3. Stir in the peas and 7 basil leaves. Simmer until the peas are heated through, 3–4 minutes.
4. Purée the soup in batches in a blender until smooth. Return the soup to a clean pot set over low heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Do not boil the soup or the bright green color will be lost.
5. Rub the olive oil onto the remaining 8 basil leaves.
6. Ladle the soup into warmed bowls, garnish each with a basil leaf, and serve immediately.
