This recipe takes you to the bustling streets of Thailand, where small grills are perched on every corner, grilling pork, satays, dumplings, and squid. The smoky aroma of the grilled pork skewers is so enticing that it's hard to resist breaking into the cache on the way home. While not everyone has a charcoal grill, these pork skewers can also be cooked on a chargrill plate or under a preheated grill.

### Ingredients

* `300 g` pork loin or neck
* `50 g` pork back fat (optional)
* `12-15` bamboo skewers
* `3` pandanus leaves (optional)
* `1/4 cup` coconut cream

**For the Marinade**
* `1 tsp` cleaned and chopped coriander roots
* `pinch` of salt
* `1 tsp` chopped garlic
* `½ tsp` ground white pepper
* `2 tbsp` shaved palm sugar
* `dash` of dark soy sauce
* `2 tbsp` fish sauce
* `2 tbsp` vegetable oil

### Directions

1. Slice the pork into thinnish pieces about `2 cm` square. Cut the pork fat, if using, into small rectangles, say `2 cm x 5 mm`.
2. Next, prepare the marinade. Using a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander root, salt, garlic, and pepper into a fine paste. Combine with the sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce, and oil. Marinate the pork and fat in this mixture for about 3 hours. If refrigerating, it is best marinated overnight.
3. Soak the bamboo skewers in water for about 30 minutes. This prevents them from scorching and burning as the pork grills.
4. To make a pandanus brush, fold each pandanus leaf in half then trim to make an even edge. Cut up into the trimmed ends four or five times to make the brush's 'bristles. Tie the pandanus leaves together with string or an elastic band to make a brush. A regular brush will do too.
5. Prepare the grill. Meanwhile, thread a piece of pork fat, if using, onto the skewer first followed by two or three pieces of the marinated pork. Repeat with each skewer.
6. When the embers are glowing, gently grill the skewers, turning quite often to prevent charring and promote even caramelisation and cooking. Dab them with the coconut cream as they grill. This should make the coals smoulder and impart a smoky taste. Grill all the skewers.
7. On the streets, they are simply reheated over the grill to warm them through before serving, although this is not entirely necessary as they are delicious warm or cool.

### Notes

- If you don't have a charcoal grill, these pork skewers can also be cooked on a chargrill plate on the stovetop or under a preheated grill. While the taste will be less complex, they will still be extremely agreeable.
- The Thais use mangrove charcoal from near the mouth of the Chao Phraya River for an authentic taste.
- Very often there will be a small piece of pork fat at the bottom of the skewer. This helps to moisten the pork as it grills.
