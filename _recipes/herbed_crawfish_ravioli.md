This recipe is a classic from Louisiana Cookin, bringing the rich flavors of the bayou to your kitchen.

### Ingredients

* `3 tbsp` butter
* `4 oz` tasso, finely chopped
* `¼ cup` chopped onion
* `2` cloves garlic, chopped
* `1 cup` dry white wine
* `2 (5.2-ounce)` packages garlic-and-herb-flavored Boursin cheese
* `8 oz` cooked crawfish tails, finely chopped
* `2 (12-ounce)` packages refrigerated wonton wrappers
* Creole Lemon Cream Sauce (recipe follows)
* Garnish: parsley

### Directions

1. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add tasso, onion, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until onion is tender. Add wine, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and cook until reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 6 minutes. Stir in cheese and crawfish, stirring until cheese is melted. Remove from heat, and let cool for 30 minutes or refrigerate for up to 2 days.
2. Place about 2 teaspoons cheese mixture in center of half of wontons. Brush edges of wrappers lightly with water; cover with remaining wonton wrappers, pressing edges to seal.
3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add wontons, in batches, and simmer until wontons are tender and filling is heated, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove wontons from pot; let drain. Divide wontons among serving dishes. Top with Creole Lemon Cream Sauce. Garnish with parsley, if desired.
