Potlikker (or “pot liquor”) is the brothy, nutrient-dense liquid gold traditionally left behind after boiling greens and beans. An ingredient whose use sheds light on the complex racialized history of Southern cooking, potlikker was once valued only by diligent enslaved Africans who saved the nourishing broth for their families after cooking greens. Chef Carla Hall, for whom potlikker was an essential element of her childhood, switches up the order, making potlikker from scratch to use as an ultra-concentrated broth—for Hall, that’s often the first step in imbuing a dish with layers of deep, powerful flavor.

### Ingredients

* `⅔ cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `4` medium onions, thinly sliced
* `1 cup` garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
* `4 tsp.` crushed red pepper flakes
* `¼ cup` smoked paprika
* `¼ cup` sun-dried tomato paste
* `2 tbsp.` red wine vinegar
* `4 tsp.` Diamond Crystal or `2¼ tsp.` Morton kosher salt
* Freshly ground black pepper

### Directions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Cook onions and garlic, stirring often, until onions are translucent, 6–8 minutes. Add red pepper flakes; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add paprika and tomato paste; cook, stirring, until tomato paste is a shade darker, about 2 minutes. Stir in vinegar, salt, and 5 cups water; season with pepper. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors have melded, 30–35 minutes.
2. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium heatproof bowl; discard solids.

### Notes

- Potlikker can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool. Transfer to an airtight container and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
