### Ingredients

* `700 grams` (tipo 0 or tipo 1) flour
* `5 grams` (~1 1/4 teaspoons) dried or instant yeast
* `490 ml` (~1 1/2 cups) water
* `28 grams` (~1 1/2 tablespoons) extra virgin olive oil
* `14 grams` (~1/2 tablespoon) sea salt
* Pelati tomatoes, crushed and seasoned with sea salt

### Directions

1. Mix the flour, yeast, and water in a large bowl with a spoon. When most of the lumps are gone, add the olive oil and salt. It will be wet. The wetter the better.
2. Flip onto a floured work surface and gently fold the dough in half, over itself, toward you. Grab the dough by the corners facing you, pick it up like an envelope and turn 90 degrees and place back on the floured surface. Gently fold and turn. Repeat a few more times.
3. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rest 15 minutes. Then repeat the folding and turning action as above. By the third pass, the dough will be springy and less sticky.
4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for 24 hours. The next day, take the dough out of the refrigerator and let come to room temperature, about 1 hour.
5. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Lightly oil a 9"x13" baking pan.
6. Lightly flour your work surface. Place the dough on the work surface. Start with the edges of the dough and press down gently and then go to the center and press down. After the first passage, flip the far end over, so the top becomes the bottom. Make sure your flour is evenly distributed under the dough and continue to gently massage the dough, so the balls of air remain intact. Flip again and repeat until the dough is evenly distributed.
7. Pull the dough over your arm and then pull the other side over your other arm with your palms facing down. Transfer the dough to the baking pan and distribute the dough toward the edges of the pan. Press down, distributing the dough evenly, but gently.
8. Add the pelati tomatoes. Distribute evenly with your hands. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.
9. Place the pan on the bottom floor of your oven for the first 5 minutes. Then transfer to the bottom-middle rack of your oven and cook another 15-20 minutes.
10. Add cheese and other desired toppings and place back in the oven until the cheese is melted. Top with (fresh) ingredients (e.g., basil, arugula, spinach, prosciutto, speck).

### Notes

- The pizza is topped with Pelati tomatoes (peeled, canned, uncooked Italian tomatoes), sea salt, and extra-virgin olive oil. Spread the tomatoes around and then drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Then into the oven.

This is attempt #3. The bottom is nice and crispy and the dough nice and light and airy (got some nice air pockets in the dough)…still needs work, but slowly getting there.

At this point, you can add your toppings and pop the pizza back in the oven until the cheese melts and the toppings are warmed through.
