This salad is made with finely shredded cabbage and carrot, tossed with a spiced Indian coconut “sambal” of sorts. Based on the traditional South Indian _Thoran_ dry curries, this is ridiculously delicious!

### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` coconut oil, unrefined
* `3/4 tsp` black mustard seeds
* `3/4 tsp` cumin seeds
* `3` eschalots (USA: shallots), finely diced
* `1/2` large onion, finely diced
* `3` garlic cloves, finely minced
* `1` green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
* `12` curry leaves, fresh
* `1/2 tsp` turmeric powder
* `1/2 cup` desiccated coconut, unsweetened
* `1/2 cup` water
* `3/4 tsp` salt
* `1/4` small red cabbage, very finely sliced
* `2` small carrots or 1 very large carrot, peeled and finely shredded

#### Garnish:

* `1/4 cup` fresh coriander/cilantro leaves, roughly chopped

### Directions

1. Melt oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat.
2. Add black mustard seeds and cook for 30 seconds – they will pop and sizzle
3. Add cumin seeds and cook for 30 seconds.
4. Add eschalot and onion, cook for 3 minutes until translucent but not coloured.
5. Add garlic and green chilli, cook for 2 minutes until softened but not golden.
6. Add turmeric and curry leaves, cook for 30 seconds.
7. Add coconut, water and salt. Cook until water mostly evaporates – about 3 minutes.
8. Place carrot and cabbage in a large bowl. Add hot coconut mixture. Toss well – the cabbage should wilt from the heat.
9. Taste and check if it needs more salt for your taste.
10. Toss through coriander. Serve warm or at room temperature.

### Notes

Best eaten on the day of making. If you are expecting leftovers or intend to reheat, it is best to cook the cabbage instead of just wilting it, as per the recipe. Just add all the cabbage and carrot into the skillet and cook it until wilted.
