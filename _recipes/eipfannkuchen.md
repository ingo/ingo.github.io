category: Breakfasts
description: These huge, bigger-than-my-head, eggy pancakes, which my Oma would cook for me after a cold morning tromping through the snow. My favorite topping is melted butter with a little honey, but they can be topped like normal crepes. You'll want to serve them immediately out of the pan with a knife and fork to cut them into squares.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` milk
* `1 cup` flour
* `3` eggs
* Butter
* Honey

### Directions

1. Beat eggs and milk. Add flour. Heat a large saut√© pan (approximately 12" in diameter) over medium high heat and grease with a little butter. When pan is hot (a drop of water jumps across the surface), pour in about half the batter and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Let cook until golden brown on one side and then flip. Cook 30 seconds more and then remove to plate.
2. Top with butter and honey immediately and serve.
