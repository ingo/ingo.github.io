title: Chicken Under a Brick
---

This Italian chicken dish involves weighing the chicken down as it cooks, ideally on the grill. The heavy object, whether a cast-iron pan, bricks, or other weight, presses the chicken so it cooks up incredibly moist and infused with flavor.

### Ingredients

* `1` small chicken, cut in half down the breastbone, and pounded fairly flat (approx 3 lbs.)
* `Juice of 1` lemon
* `1 clove` of garlic, crushed
* Fresh rosemary, chopped
* `3-4 tbsp.` olive oil
* salt
* pepper

### Directions

1. Rub the chicken with all ingredients and let marinate for several hours. 
2. Heat the grill until medium-hot (you should be able to hold your hand 5 in" above the grill for 3 sec).
3. Place chicken, skin side down, and add weight. Cover grill. Grill until dark grill marks appear, approx. 12 minutes. 
4. Turn skin side up, re-apply weight and cover, and grill until juices run clear, approx. 15 minutes more.
5. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
