### Ingredients

* One "fresh ham" with bone in (or have your butcher butterfly it for you!) and skin on. You can also use a small pork roast with a good layer of fat on it. I prefer a picnic shoulder, approximately `8-10 lbs`.

### Mojo Marinade

* `20` cloves garlic
* `2 tsp` salt
* `1 1/2 cups` sour orange juice (approximately 10 oranges) (In a pinch, use two parts orange to one part lemon and one part lime)
* `1 cup` minced onion
* `1 tsp` oregano
* `1 1/2 cups` Spanish olive oil

### Directions

1. For marinade, mash the garlic and salt together with a mortar and pestle. (A rolling pin on a cutting board works pretty good too.) Add dried oregano, onion and the sour orange to the mash and mix thoroughly. Heat oil in small sauce pan, add the mash to the oil and whisk
2. Pierce pork as many times as you can with a sharp knife or fork. Pour garlic mixture (save a little for roasting) over pork, cover and let sit in refrigerator for 2-3 hours or overnight.
3. **Oven Directions** Preheat oven to 450째F.
4. Place the pork fattest side up in an open roasting pan. Place pan in oven and reduce temperature to 325째F. Spoon extra marinade over the roast occasionally as it cooks. Using a meat thermometer, roast should be removed from the oven when the temperature reaches 155째F. Immediately cover with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. The roast will continue to cook after you remove it from the heat. A perfectly cooked pork roast will be pale white in the middle and the juices will run clear. This should take approximately 3-4 hours.
5. **Barbecue Grill** Use a covered grill, such as the Webber kettle or a covered gas grill. Bank the coals to each side, leaving an empty space beneath your ham. If using a gas grill, use front and rear burners only. The idea is to cook with indirect heat. Spoon extra marinade over the roast occasionally as it cooks. If not using a gas grill, add charcoal to the sides as needed to maintain roasting temperature. Using a meat thermometer, roast should be removed from the grill when the temperature reaches 155째F. Immediately cover with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. The roast will continue to cook after you remove it from the heat. A perfectly cooked pork roast will be pale white in the middle and the juices will run clear.
6. **Stovetop** Place ham in a large Dutch oven, or a covered stock pan -- whatever you have that the pork will fit in. Add about one cup of marinade to the pan. Bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to low, cover and cook until completely done. Add additional marinade as needed to keep at least one inch of liquid in bottom of pan - otherwise the roast will burn.
