A classic Italian pizza recipe that you can easily make at home. Choose between a long fermentation process for a more complex flavor or a same-day process for instant gratification.

### Ingredients

* `200g` starter (100% hydration)
* `464g` water
* `600g` flour
* `5.5g` instant yeast (for long fermentation)
* `8.5g` instant yeast (for same day)
* `21g` salt
* `50g` water

### Directions

1. Combine the starter, water, and flour in a large bowl. Mix until no dry flour remains. Let rest for 30 minutes.
2. Dissolve the yeast in water, then add to the dough along with the salt. Mix until well combined.
3. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.
4. Let the dough rise until it has doubled in size. This will take longer if you're using the smaller amount of yeast for long fermentation.
5. Preheat your oven to its highest setting.
6. Divide the dough into two equal parts and shape each into a 11x15” pizza.
7. Add your favorite toppings and bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

### Notes

- The fermentation time can greatly affect the flavor of your pizza. For a more complex, sourdough-like flavor, use the smaller amount of yeast and let the dough rise for a longer period of time. For a quicker pizza with a milder flavor, use the larger amount of yeast and let the dough rise until it has just doubled in size.
