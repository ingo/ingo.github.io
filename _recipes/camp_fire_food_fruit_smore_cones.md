This recipe is a delightful twist on the traditional campfire s'mores. Instead of graham crackers, we use waffle cones to hold the delicious mix of marshmallows, chocolate, and fresh fruit. It's a fun and easy dessert that's perfect for camping trips or backyard bonfires.

### Ingredients

* Chopped fruit (strawberries, bananas, or any berries or tart apples)
* `1 bag` [Mini-Marshmallows](https://amzn.to/2Ygm9g5)
* `1 bag` [Chocolate Chips](https://amzn.to/2HbuaNP) (semi-dark preferred for extra antioxidants)
* Waffle Ice-Cream Cones
* [Tin Foil](https://amzn.to/2YfE6Lx) for wrapping

### Directions

1. Chop the fruit into smaller, more manageable bits.
2. Mix all of the ingredients together in a metal bowl.
3. Wrap the waffle cones in foil.
4. Stuff the waffle cones with the mixture until they are brimming and overflowing.
5. Fold the foil over the top and lay them over the fire, once the coals have turned gray.
6. Rotate the cones a couple of times.
7. After about 5-7 minutes, they are ready to eat!

### Notes

- You can eat the cones as you would ice cream, or use a spoon. This is a very gooey treat! Other variations to try include using caramel bits and apple slices, or adding toffee, or another favorite candy bar chopped into bits.
