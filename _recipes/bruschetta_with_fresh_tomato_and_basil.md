title: Bruschetta with Fresh Tomato and Basil
---

Served piled atop warm, garlicky toast for an easy appetizer or light meal. The fresh tomatoes, flavored with olive oil, vinegar and basil make a simple yet delicious topping. When served on the crisp garlic toasts, it creates the perfect balance of flavors and textures.

### Ingredients

* `4` ripe medium tomatoes, about 1/2 pound each, coarsely chopped
* `1 cup` torn basil leaves, firmly packed
* `2 tsp` extra virgin olive oil
* `1 tsp` red wine vinegar
* `1` clove garlic, pounded into a paste with `1/2 tsp` salt
* `12 slices` bruschetta

### Directions

1. In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, basil, olive oil and vinegar. Add 1/4 teaspoon of the garlic paste, and blend well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours, if possible.
2. Place the bruschetta on a large platter in a single layer. When ready to serve, drizzle each one with about 1 tablespoon of juice from the bottom of the bowl containing the tomato mixture. With a slotted spoon, strew the tomato mixture over the bruschetta. Serve immediately.
