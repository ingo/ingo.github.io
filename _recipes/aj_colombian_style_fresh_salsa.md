### Ingredients

* `1 packed cup` cilantro, leaves and tender stems
* `½` small white or yellow onion
* `3` scallions
* `1` serrano or Fresno chile, or jalapeño
* `½` ripe beefsteak tomato
* Kosher salt
* Lime wedges, for serving

### Directions

1. Finely mince the cilantro, onion, scallions and chile by hand, or by roughly chopping, then pulsing in a food processor. Transfer to a medium bowl.
2. Working directly in the medium bowl and using a flat palm to press the cut side of the tomato against the large holes of a box grater, grate the tomato until you’re left with just the skin. (The skin should protect your hand from the grater.) Discard the skin.
3. Add `1 tsp` kosher salt and a few tablespoons of water. Squeeze with lime juice to taste. Stir to combine. The ají should be quite thin in texture. Add more water as necessary. Taste and season with more salt, if desired. Finished ají can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
