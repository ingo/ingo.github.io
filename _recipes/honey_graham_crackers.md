The flavor of the honey absolutely comes through, making these crackers as tempting as your favorite cookie. Store-bought graham crackers are fine, but these homemade honey graham crackers from “The Fannie Farmer Baking Book,” a classic by beloved cookbook author Marion Cunningham, will change your mind. They have the nutty flavor and hearty texture of a graham cracker, but the flavor of the honey makes them as tempting as your favorite cookie.

### Ingredients

* `4 tbsp` unsalted butter, softened
* `1` large egg, well beaten
* `6 tbsp` granulated sugar
* `1/4 cup` honey
* `1/2 tsp` baking soda
* `2 tsp` water
* `3/4 tsp` salt
* `1 1/2 cups` whole-wheat flour, plus extra for dusting
* `3/4 cup` all-purpose flour

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Have 2 ungreased rimmed baking sheets at hand.
2. Combine the butter, egg and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or handheld electric mixer; beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the honey and beat to incorporate.
3. In a small bowl or jar, dissolve the baking soda in the water, then add to the butter mixture and beat to combine briefly; then reduce the mixer speed to low, add the salt, whole-wheat flour and all-purpose flour and mix to thoroughly combine. The dough should hold together, be manageable and start to form larger clumps around the paddle. If it is too tacky, add a little more whole-wheat flour.
4. Liberally dust a work surface with whole-wheat flour and roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch, into a rectangle slightly larger than 10 inches by 16 inches. Use a knife to trim the edges into straight lines and then cut into 14 rectangles that are 5 inches by 2¼ inches. Use the tines of a fork to score each rectangle into fourths, taking care not to punch all the way through the dough. Then lightly prick each quarter a few times. Use a thin spatula to transfer the rectangles to the baking sheets.
5. Bake for 8 minutes, then turn the crackers over and bake for 8 to 12 minutes, until golden brown and baked through. More time will yield a darker, crispier cracker. Transfer the crackers to a wire rack to cool before serving or storing.

### Notes

- To make cinnamon graham crackers, substitute 1/4 cup of sugar for the honey and add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the dry ingredients before combining. The crackers can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.
