A classic Italian dish that's sure to impress. This classic Italian dish is a labor of love, but the result is worth it. The gnocchi are soft, pillowy, and perfect with any sauce. 

### Ingredients

* `2 lbs` potatoes
* `2` egg yolks
* `1/2 cup` flour

### Directions

1. Start by skinning the potatoes and then boil them until soft.
2. Push the soft potatoes through a fine mesh sifter into a bowl.
3. For every lbs of potato add one egg yolk and add roughly 1/4 cup of flour. Mix together.
4. Roll the gnocchi dough into a skinny log and cut into 1-1.5inch pieces. 
5. Do this until all dough is used up and then freeze until firm.
6. Add to boiling water when ready to cook!

### Notes

- You can serve these gnocchi with any sauce you like. They're particularly good with a simple tomato sauce or a creamy gorgonzola sauce.
