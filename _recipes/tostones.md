### Ingredients

* `2 cups` water
* `3` cloves garlic, smashed
* `2 tsp` kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning
* `1 1/2 cups` vegetable or canola oil
* `2` green plantains

### Directions

1. Combine water, garlic and salt in medium size glass bowl and set aside. 
2. Peel plantains and slice crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Place them in the bowl to soak for at least 15 minutes, and up to several hours.
3. Remove plantains from water and try on paper towels. In a large (12-inch) saute pan, heat oil to 325 degrees F. Carefully add plantains to oil and fry until golden yellow in color, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side. (The oil should come halfway up the side of the plantain). 
4. With a spider or slotted spoon, remove the plantains from the pan and place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, standing them on their ends. With the back of a wide, wooden spatula, press each piece of plantain down to half its original size.
5. Bring oil back up to 325 degrees F and return plantains to pan and cook until golden brown, approximately 2 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a dish lined with paper towels, and sprinkle with salt. Serve immediately.
