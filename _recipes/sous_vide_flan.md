This Sous Vide Flan recipe is a unique take on the traditional flan dessert, using a sous vide cooker to achieve a perfectly smooth and creamy texture. The recipe was originally found on Allrecipes.com.

### Ingredients

* `8` 4-ounce MasonÂ® jars with lids and rings
* `1` 14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk
* `1` 12 fluid ounce can evaporated milk
* `3` eggs
* `1 tbsp` vanilla extract

### Directions

1. Place a sous vide cooker inside a large heat-proof container filled with water. Preheat the water bath to 179 degrees F (82 degrees C).
2. Melt sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour hot melted sugar into eight 4 ounce Mason jars, enough to cover the bottom of each.
3. Mix sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Add to the jars; seal.
4. Place jars in the water bath and set timer for 1 hour.
5. Remove jars from the water bath. Let flan cool until safe to handle, about 20 minutes.
6. Unseal jars and run a small rubber spatula around the sides of the flan. Top each flan with a plate; invert and gently shake to release.

### Notes

- Cook's Note: You can replace the vanilla extract with 1 scraped vanilla bean.
