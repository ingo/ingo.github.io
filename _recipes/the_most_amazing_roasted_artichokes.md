title: The Most Amazing Roasted Artichokes
---
Since moving to Barcelona, our veggie bowl has mysteriously been stocked with fresh artichokes pretty much 24/7. Artichokes are by far and away Barclay’s favorite food. After a long history of steaming our artichokes, I began feeling the need for a little variety in our artichoke game happening here in Spain. So I challenged Barc to experiment with some various methods and seasonings for roasted artichokes. And now, dozens of alcachofas asadas later, we’ve both agreed that he’s landed upon a winner of a recipe.

### Ingredients

* `3` fresh artichokes
* `2` large fresh lemons, juiced
* `2 tbsp` olive oil (or melted butter)
* `6` cloves garlic, peeled and roughly-chopped
* fresh rosemary (plus additional fresh thyme, oregano, or sage, if you’d like)
* coarse sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper

### Directions

1. Heat oven to 400°F.
2. Use a knife to slice off the bottom 1/2-inch (or more, if you’d like) of the artichoke stems, and the top 1 inch of the artichoke globes (the leaves on top). Remove and discard any small leaves toward the bottoms of the stems. Rinse the artichokes with water.
3. Slice the artichokes in half vertically. Use a spoon to scoop out the fuzzy “choke” in the middle of the artichoke. Then use kitchen shears to trim about 1/4/-inch off the pointy tips of each of the artichoke leaves (so that they don’t poke you when you eat them). Rub a lemon wedge all over the entire surface of each artichoke half, to prevent browning.
4. Place the artichoke halves in a baking dish or on a baking sheet cut-side-up. Brush the cut sides of the artichokes evenly with the olive oil. Then fill the cavities evenly with the garlic, followed by a few small sprigs of the fresh herbs. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Flip the artichokes over, using the herbs to help hold in the garlic, so that they are cut-side-down. Brush the tops of the artichokes with oil, and season with salt and pepper.
6. Bake uncovered for 15 minutes. Then remove and cover the pan with aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 25-35 minutes, or until the artichokes are tender and the leaves pull off easily.
7. Place the tray on a cooling rack. Carefully remove, discard the herbs (or stir them into your dipping sauce for extra flavor), and drizzle the artichokes with extra lemon juice.
8. Serve the roasted artichokes warm with your desired dipping sauce.

### Notes

Dipping Sauce Ideas:

* Lemony Melted Butter Sauce: I make mine with about 1 part melted butter, 1 part freshly-squeezed lemon juice, 1 part water, and salt and pepper to taste.
* Blender Hollandaise Sauce: This version is super easy.
* Tzaziki Sauce: For a Mediterranean twist.
* Pesto: Rich and delicious. Feel free to mix in some Greek yogurt to make it creamy.
* Mayo or Aioli: Always a win.
