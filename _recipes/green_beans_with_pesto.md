title: Green Beans with Pesto
---
This recipe is a delightful combination of fresh green beans and homemade pesto sauce. The green beans are blanched to retain their vibrant color and crunch. The pesto sauce is a flavorful blend of garlic, parmesan cheese, roasted pine nuts, and basil leaves. The dish is then garnished with torn basil leaves and more pine nuts for an added crunch.

### Ingredients

* `200g` green beans
* `2 cloves` garlic
* `50g` parmesan cheese
* `50g` roasted pine nuts
* `1 bunch` basil leaves
* `2 tbsp` olive oil

### Directions

1. Blanch the green beans in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then drain and set aside.
2. To make the pesto, combine the garlic, parmesan cheese, half of the roasted pine nuts, and half of the basil leaves in a food processor. Gradually add the olive oil while the processor is running until a smooth sauce is formed.
3. Toss the blanched green beans in the pesto sauce until they are well coated.
4. Garnish the dish with the remaining torn basil leaves and pine nuts before serving.

### Notes

You can adjust the amount of garlic and parmesan cheese in the pesto sauce according to your taste. Also, make sure to not overcook the green beans to retain their crunch and vibrant color.
