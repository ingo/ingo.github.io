This recipe comes from a pizza enthusiast from Modena, Italy, who shared his recipe on the Pizza Making Forum. The pizza is made in the Bonci style, which involves stretching the dough, placing it in an unoiled pan, topping it, and baking it in two stages. The result is a pizza with a soft and fluffy crumb, and a perfect balance of toppings.

### Ingredients

* `30%` Semola Senatore Cappelli
* `70%` Pivetti Flour (Girasole W350)
* `75%` Hydration
* `0.7%` Compressed Yeast
* `3%` Trapani Salt

### Directions

1. Mix the flours, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl.
2. Gradually add water, mixing until a dough forms.
3. Let the dough mature for 48 hours at a controlled temperature.
4. Stretch the dough and place it in an unoiled pan.
5. Add the first layer of toppings and bake for 4 minutes at 310 degrees C.
6. Add the second layer of toppings and bake for another 4 minutes.
7. In the last 2 minutes of baking, add mozzarella cheese.

### Notes

* The dough's hydration percentage is 75%.
* The dough is baked in two stages, with toppings added in between.
* For a focaccia style pizza, add the sauce in the second part of the bake.
* To calculate the right weight for the dough, use the area system of the pan (e.g., 30x40/2).
* This pizza is meant to be crunchy, but can be cooked softer if preferred.
* Always use scissors to cut the pizza to avoid crushing the crumb.
