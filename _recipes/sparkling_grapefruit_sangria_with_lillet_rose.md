description: This sparkling sangria makes use of the French aperitif Lillet Rosé,
  which comes already flavored with sweet and bitter orange peel and fruit liqueurs
  to boost the flavor of the pitcher drink. Grapefruit adds crisp tartness, just right
  for a hot day.

**Note:** To make simple syrup, combine `1 cup` water with `1 cup` sugar in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Cool before using. Simple syrup will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

### Ingredients

* `15` fresh mint leaves
* `1/4 cup` simple syrup (see note above)
* `1 cup` fresh grapefruit juice, from about 2 Ruby Red grapefruits, plus `1/2` of one grapefruit, peel intact, cut into rough chunks
* `1 cup` Lillet Rosé
* `1 bottle` Cava, chilled

### Directions

1. In the bottom of a pitcher, gently muddle together the mint leaves and simple syrup. Add grapefruit chunks, grapefruit juice, and Lillet Rosé. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.
2. When ready to serve, add Cava to the pitcher and stir gently. Serve over ice.
