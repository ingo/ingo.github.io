### Ingredients

* `2` 3-pound tri-tip roasts
* Basting Sauce
  * `1/2 cup` red wine vinegar
  * `1/2 cup` garlic-infused vegetable oil
* Seasoning Salt Mixture
  * `2 tsp` freshly ground black pepper
  * `2 tsp` white pepper
  * `2 tsp` cayenne pepper
  * `1 tsp` onion powder
  * `4 tbsp` granulated garlic
  * `6 tbsp` salt

### Directions

1. Heat a grill to low.
2. Coat both sides of the tri-tips with half of the seasoning mixture, rubbing it in as you would a dry rub. Let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. Place the tri-tips over a low temperature fire, 1 with fat side up, and the other with fat side down.
4. Turn as the first side gets crispy, approximately 6 to 8 minutes. Be careful of flare-ups, as the dripping fat will fuel the fire.
5. Turn the tri-tips before the heat pushes juices out the top, and continue to turn using this timing method throughout the cooking process.
6. After turning, baste with sauce and season lightly, 4 times per side.
7. Continue turning until the tri-tips are cooked to your liking.
8. Remove from fire and let rest for 10 minutes before cutting into 1/2-inch slices against the grain.

### Seasoning Salt Mixture Directions

1. Mix together all ingredients in a small bowl.

### Basting Sauce Directions

1. Whisk together vinegar and oil in a small bowl.
