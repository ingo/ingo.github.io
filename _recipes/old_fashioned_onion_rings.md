This recipe for crispy coated onion rings comes from a former employee of a popular drive-in restaurant. They're just like the pros make!

### Ingredients

* `1` large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices
* `1 1/4 cups` all-purpose flour
* `1 teaspoon` baking powder
* `1 teaspoon` salt
* `1` egg
* `1 cup` milk, or as needed
* `3/4 cup` dry bread crumbs
* `seasoned salt to taste`
* `1 quart` oil for frying, or as needed

### Directions

1. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
2. Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.
3. Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier cleanup. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.
4. Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.
