The Barranco district of Lima is an exciting neighborhood filled with restaurants and bars that attract musicians, poets, writers, and bohemians. Barranco is full of color and history, and its proximity to the sea and its stunning surroundings make the cooking in its restaurants dynamic, diverse, and entertaining. We had its spirit very much in mind when creating our restaurant in London, so we had to name a recipe after it.

### Ingredients

* `14 oz / 400 g` sea bass fillet (or other white fish), skinned and trimmed
* `1/2` green mango, peeled
* A squeeze of `orange juice`
* `1/2 portion` Amarillo Chile Tiger's Milk (page 230)
* `1` limo chile, seeded and very finely chopped
* Chopped basil leaves or micro basil
* Fine sea salt

### Directions

1. Cut the fish as thinly as you can on the diagonal across the grain into slices. Arrange the fish on 4 plates, add a sprinkle of salt, and leave for 2 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, grate the mango and add the gratings to a bowl with the orange juice.
3. Pour the tiger's milk over the fish and add the mango.
4. Sprinkle with the chile and basil to finish.

### Notes

- The dish is named after the Barranco district of Lima, known for its vibrant and diverse culinary scene.
- You can replace sea bass with any other white fish of your choice.
- The Amarillo Chile Tiger's Milk can be found on page 230 of the original recipe book.
