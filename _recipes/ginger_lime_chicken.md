description: Buzzing with the bright flavors of ginger and lime, this chicken dish
  is a delightful surprise. The secret ingredient is mayonnaise, which carries flavor,
  sticks to the meat well, encourages browning and prevents the pieces of lime zest
  and ginger from burning. Serve with a pile of white rice and a fresh green salad
  topped with thinly sliced avocado.

title: Ginger-Lime Chicken
---
### Ingredients

* `1 ½ to 2 pounds` boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts 
* Kosher salt and black pepper 
* `⅓ cup` mayonnaise 
* `1 tablespoon` lime zest (from about 2 limes), plus lime wedges, for serving 
* `1 tablespoon` finely grated fresh ginger (from a 3-inch piece of peeled ginger) 

### Directions

1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, lime zest and ginger; season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the mayonnaise mixture and stir to coat. (The chicken can sit in the marinade for up to 8 hours in the fridge. Let come to room temperature before cooking.)
2. To grill: Heat a grill to medium-high. Grill the chicken over direct heat until cooked through and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and about 4 minutes per side for breasts, turning as necessary to avoid burning.
3. To cook in a skillet: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Cook the chicken until juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and about 4 minutes per side for breasts.
4. Serve chicken with lime wedges, for squeezing on top.
