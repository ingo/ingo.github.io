With their delightful mild tang, sourdough pancakes and waffles evoke memories of Gold Rush days in California, when sourdough in some form was served to miners morning, noon, and night. Be it in the shape of biscuits, a crusty loaf, or these breakfast treats, sourdough is an enduring American tradition.

### Ingredients

* `2 cups` King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
* `2 tbsp` sugar
* `2 cups` buttermilk
* `1 cup` sourdough starter, unfed/discard
* `2` large eggs
* `1/4 cup` vegetable oil or `4 tbsp` butter, melted
* `3/4 tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` baking soda

### Directions

1. To make the overnight sponge, stir down your refrigerated starter, and remove 1 cup. _Note: This is a good opportunity to feed the remainder, if necessary._
2. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the 1 cup unfed starter, flour, sugar, and buttermilk.
3. Cover and let rest at cool room temperature (about 65°F to 70°F) for about 12 hours, or overnight.
4. In a small bowl or mixing cup, beat together the eggs, and oil or butter. Add to the overnight sponge.
5. Add the salt and baking soda, stirring to combine. The batter will bubble.
6. Pour batter onto your preheated, greased waffle iron, and bake according to the manufacturer's instructions.
7. Serve waffles immediately, to ensure crispness. Or hold in a warm oven till ready to serve.

### Notes

* Want to make pancakes? Simply cook the batter in rounds on a griddle, rather than in a waffle iron.
* For whole-grain waffles, substitute our white whole wheat flour or Premium whole wheat flour for some or all of the all-purpose flour.
* Don’t have any starter? Here’s a recipe for homemade sourdough starter. If you're making it from scratch, you'll need to feed it for 5 to 7 days before it’s ready for baking. Want a head start? Purchase our classic fresh sourdough starter – it’ll be ready for baking soon after it arrives at your door. Looking for tips, techniques, and all kinds of great information about sourdough baking?

* Can these pancakes and waffles be made gluten-free? Absolutely. Make sure to use a gluten-free starter; and substitute our Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour for the all-purpose flour called for in the recipe.
