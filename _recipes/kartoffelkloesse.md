### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` butter
* `1` slice stale white bread cut into 72 equal pieces
* `1 1/3 c` (less 1 tsp.) flour, divided
* `1 lb. 14 oz.` peeled cooked boiling potatoes, riced
* `1` egg
* `1 tsp` salt
* `1/8 tsp` ground nutmeg
* `1/8 tsp` white pepper
* `4 qt` water

### Directions

1. In small skillet heat margarine until bubbly and hot; add bread and saute, stirring constantly, until bread has absorbed the margarine and is browned. Set aside. 
2. Measure out and reserve 2 tablespoons flour. In mixing bowl combine remaining flour with potatoes, egg, and seasonings, mixing well; portion dough into 24 equal mounds. 
3. Flour hands with reserved flour and shape mounds into balls; press 3 bread cubes into each ball and seal closed, forming dumplings.
4. In 5-quart saucepan or Dutch oven bring water to a boil; use slotted spoon to gently lower several dumplings into water (they will sink to the bottom); when dumplings rise to surface, cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer. 
5. With slotted spoon, remove dumplings to warmed serving platter. Repeat procedure with remaining dumplings.
