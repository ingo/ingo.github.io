The dough only needs to rise once, keeping the active time short. Letting the shaped
  buns proof uncovered helps give them a nice crust. The all-purpose flour lends tenderness
  while the bread flour develops gluten for a chewy yet soft texture. The simple combination
  of flours makes these easy to throw together. Let them proof after shaping to get
  that nice golden crust on the buns.

### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` active dry yeast
* `1 cup + 2 tbsp` warm water (110° to 115°)
* `1/3 cup` vegetable oil
* `1/4 cup` sugar
* `1 tsp` salt
* `3 to 3-1/2 cups` all-purpose flour

### Directions

1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add oil and sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the egg, salt and enough flour to form a soft dough.
2. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 3-5 minutes. Do not let rise. Divide into 12 pieces; shape each into a ball. Place 3 in. apart on greased baking sheets.
3. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Bake at 425° for 8-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
