This recipe was born out of a love for scallop sashimi and a desire to experiment with different flavor combinations. It has since become one of the most loved dishes on our menu.

### Ingredients

* `12` large sea scallops, each cut horizontally into `3` thin slices
* `2` limes, cut in half
* Seeds from `1/2` pomegranate
* `1` limo chile, seeded and finely chopped
* `2 tbsp` pisco (or a good-quality vodka)
* `4 tbsp` Cilantro Oil
* A small handful of freshly torn cilantro leaves or micro cilantro
* Fine sea salt

### Directions

1. Arrange the slices of scallop on individual serving plates. Don't worry if you have to overlap them slightly.
2. Sprinkle some salt over them and squeeze half a lime over each plate.
3. Sprinkle with the pomegranate seeds and chile and then drizzle over a few drops of pisco and the Cilantro Oil.
4. Decorate with torn cilantro and serve straightaway.

### Notes

- Rather than serving on a plate, you can serve these scallops on clean scallop shells.
