description: An exceptionally nice eggplant salad (more like a paste) for use on bread
  or pita. Using canned tomatoes works very well and is nice in wintertime. This one
  does not contain zucchini and is adapted from a recipe by Claudia Roden.

### Ingredients

* `1` eggplant (approx 1 1/2 lbs)
* `5` cloves garlic, peeled
* `3` large beefsteak tomatoes (ripe), or `2 cups` canned crushed tomatoes.
* `4 tbsp` olive oil
* `2 tbsp` wine vinegar (or `1 tbsp` white vinegar)
* `1/2 tsp` harissa or `1/2 tsp` paprika plus a pinch ground chili pepper
* `1 tsp` ground cumin
* `1/2 cup` chopped flat-leaf parsley
* salt to taste

### Directions

1. Peel the eggplant and chop into cubes. Bring enough water to cover the eggplant (eggplant will float, so approximate) to a boil. Add some salt, garlic and eggplant. Cook until the eggplant is very soft, about 20-30 minutes. Drain well and mash eggplant with a fork.

2. If using whole tomatoes, chop and cook in a pan over low heat until reduced to a sauce, approximately 20 mins. If using canned crushed tomates, reduce this time in half. 

3. Mix with the mashed eggplant, the rest of the ingredients, and salt to taste.
