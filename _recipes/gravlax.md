Gravlax is a traditional Nordic dish made from raw salmon that's been cured with salt, sugar, and dill. It's a time-consuming process, but the result is a deliciously flavorful and unique dish that's perfect for a special occasion or just a fancy brunch!

### Ingredients

* `1.38 lbs` Salmon side
* `2 tbsp` salt
* `1 tbsp` sugar
* Fresh pepper
* `1/2 cup` finely chopped dill
* Vodka or aquavit for brushing
* Light-flavored wood for cold-smoking

### Directions

1. Combine the salt, sugar, and freshly ground pepper in a bowl.
2. Rub the salmon side with the salt mixture and the chopped dill.
3. Wrap the salmon in foil and place it in the middle of a small sheet pan.
4. Compress the salmon under a brick or other weight for 4 days, flipping sides each day. Pour off any accumulated liquid.
5. After 4 days, rinse the salmon well, and pat dry. Place it on a cooling rack over the sheet pan.
6. Brush the top side of the salmon with vodka or aquavit.
7. Let the salmon sit for 24 hours in the refrigerator.
8. Cold-smoke the salmon for 2 hours using a light-flavored wood.

### Notes

The ratio of salt to sugar for the cure is 2:1 per 1.5 lbs of fish. For example, for 680 g of fish, use 35 g of salt and 17.5 g of sugar.
