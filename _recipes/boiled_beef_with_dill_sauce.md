description: This quintessential southern German dish features beef stew meat simmered
  until meltingly tender in a broth flavored with onions, vinegar and spices. It's
  served warm or chilled with a creamy dill sauce speckled with cornichons and onions.
  A favorite of Ingo's childhood. The moist stewing makes the beef incredibly tender.
  Served chilled, the creamy dill sauce provides a cool complement. The cornichons
  add bite. Make extra - this sauce is delicious on sandwiches too!

### Directions

1. Heat oven to 250 degrees. Place beef cubes in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, toss to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium high heat in large Dutch oven or pot. Add half of meat and brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove meat and set aside on plate. Repeat process with remaining oil and meat.
2. Add onions to empty Dutch oven and sauté until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook for 30 seconds. Add stock, bay leaves and thyme and bring to a simmer. Add meat and return to a simmer. Cover and place pot in oven. Cook for 1 hour.
3. Remove pot from oven and add carrots and celery. Cover and return to oven. Cook just until meat is tender, 1 ½ to 2 hours.
4. Remove pot from oven.
5. Remove 2 cups stock from pot. Set aside.
6. Melt butter on medium heat in heavy-bottomed saucepan. When butter is melted and foam has subsided, pull pan off heat and add flour, stirring briskly. Return to heat, and stir constantly, 3-6 minutes until golden brown.
7. Pull pan off heat and quickly whisk in ½ of stock. When mixture is smooth, add in remaining stock. Cook 3-4 minutes.
8. Remove pan from heat. Mix in sour cream, dill, salt and pepper to taste.
