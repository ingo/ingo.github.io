This recipe for Skate Wing with Tomatoes and Capers is a delightful way to enjoy this unique seafood. The skate wing fillets are pan-fried to a golden brown and served with a homemade sauce of tomatoes, capers, and shallots. It's a dish that's sure to impress at any dinner table.

### Ingredients

* `16 ounce` skate wing fillet, cut into four sections
* `1/2 cup` flour for dredging
* `3 tablespoons` butter

**For the sauce:**

* `1` shallot, finely chopped
* `2` medium sized tomatoes, finely chopped
* `2 tablespoons` capers, finely chopped
* `1 to 2 tablespoons` olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Dredge each section of skate wing with flour and shake the fillets to remove excess flour. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add half of the butter to the pan. Add the skate fillets to the pan and pan-fry on one side until the surface is golden brown, then add the rest of the butter to the pan and pan-fry on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the fillets from the pan and keep on warmed plates.
2. Add the shallots to the pan and cook over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and capers to the pan, making sure to include the juices of the tomatoes. Simmer until the mixture begins to look like a thickened sauce, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste.
3. Spoon the sauce over and around each fish fillet. Serve immediately.
