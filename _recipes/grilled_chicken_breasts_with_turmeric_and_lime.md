title: Grilled Chicken Breasts With Turmeric and Lime
---

Most importantly, as with all white meat chicken, don't overcook it or you'll end up with well-seasoned shoe leather. This recipe is a simple, flavorful marinade of turmeric, rosemary, garlic, lime juice and olive oil.

### Ingredients

* `4 to 6` skinless, boneless chicken breasts, about 1 1/2 pounds 
* `2 tbsp` olive oil 
* `3 tbsp` freshly squeezed lime juice 
* `½ tsp` chile powder 
* `½ tsp` ground turmeric 
* `2 tsp` chopped fresh or crushed dried rosemary leaves 
* `1 tsp` finely minced garlic 
* Salt to taste if desired 
* Freshly ground pepper to taste 
* `2 tbsp` melted butter 

### Directions

1. Heat a grill or the broiler. Put the oil in a mixing bowl; and lime juice, chile powder, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper. Stir to blend well and add the chicken pieces. Turn them in the marinade to coat well. Cover and set aside until ready to cook. If they are to be marinated for a long period, refrigerate them.
2. Place chicken pieces on the grill or on the rack under the broiler. Cover the grill or close the door to the broiler. Cook about 2 to 3 minutes and turn the pieces. Continue cooking until done, about 2 to 3 minutes on the grill, possibly a little longer under the broiler. (Keep in mind that when this recipe was developed, in 1985, boneless chicken breasts weren’t nearly as enormous as most are today, so adjust your cook time accordingly.)
3. Remove the pieces and brush the tops with the melted butter.
