Perfect for breakfast or a hearty sandwich. This recipe was shared by a user on the Breadtopia Forum who has been making this bread for a few years. It was originally a non-sourdough version, but the user tweaked it to make a sourdough version that their daughter loves.

### Ingredients

* `1/3 cup` sourdough starter
* `1 3/4 cups` water
* `1/3 cup` molasses
* `3 tablespoons` cocoa
* `1 3/4 teaspoon` salt
* `1 1/2 cups` all-purpose unbleached flour
* `1 cup` rye flour
* `1 cup` hard red wheat flour

### Directions

1. Mix all ingredients. It will be quite sticky!
2. Let dough sit 15 minutes, then sprinkle with all-purpose flour and mix/fold. Repeat three times. 
3. Knead the dough with your hands and place in a clean, oiled bowl for overnight rising. Allow it to rise for about 15 hours, especially if the weather is chilly.
4. In the morning, form the dough into a boule and proof for about 2-3 hours.
5. Preheat the oven to 450F. Bake the bread for 20 minutes on a pre-heated baking stone. Add about 1/4 cup water before shutting the oven door to set the crust. 
6. Reduce the heat to 400F and bake for 10 more minutes. The internal temperature of the loaf should be 200F at this point. If not, reduce oven temperature to 375F and bake for 10-15 minutes more.

### Notes

- The starter hydration is not precise, but it is close to 100%.
