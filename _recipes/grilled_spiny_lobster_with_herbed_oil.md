title: Grilled Spiny Lobster with Herbed Oil
---


This recipe, sourced from OC Wild Seafood, brings the taste of the sea right to your grill. The spiny lobster, a delicacy in many cuisines, is grilled to perfection and served with a homemade herbed oil that enhances its natural flavors. The process involves par-cooking the lobsters before grilling, ensuring the meat is tender and succulent. The herbed oil, a blend of fresh herbs, garlic, and olive oil, adds a layer of complexity to the dish. It's a perfect recipe for a summer barbecue or a special occasion.

### Ingredients

#### Herbed Oil
* `1` large garlic head
* `¾ cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `½ cup` fresh flat-leaf parsley (loosely packed)
* `½ cup` fresh basil (loosely packed)
* `1½ tsp` sea salt
* `1 tsp` crushed red pepper

#### Lobsters
* `4` live whole spiny lobsters (about `1½ lb` each)
* `3 gallons` cold water
* `1½ cups` dry white wine
* `¼ cup` white wine vinegar
* `¾ cup` sea salt

#### To Serve
* `8` lemon wedges

### Directions
#### Make the Herbed Oil
1. Slice garlic head in half crosswise and peel off any loose papery skins.
2. In a small saucepan, combine garlic and olive oil. Warm gently over low heat until the garlic turns golden—about 30 minutes.
3. Remove from heat and let cool ~20 minutes. Strain the oil into a blender (discard solids).
4. Add parsley, basil, salt, and red pepper. Blend until finely pureed and the oil turns green.
5. Refrigerate until ready to grill.

#### Par-Cook the Lobsters
1. Light the coals in your grill and let them burn down until very hot (about 450–500°F).
2. In a large pot, bring the cold water, wine, vinegar, and salt to a rolling boil.
3. Add live lobsters to the water and cook 3 minutes.
4. Lift lobsters out with tongs and let cool 10 minutes before handling.

#### Grill the Lobsters
1. Using a long sharp knife, carefully split each lobster lengthwise. Try to keep the tomalley and roe intact inside the shell.
2. Brush the meat side of each lobster with about 2 teaspoons of herbed oil.
3. Place lobster meat side down on the oiled grill rack.
   - Grill 2–3 minutes until lightly charred.
   - Flip and grill about 2 minutes more until small bubbles form around the meat.
4. Remove from grill. Drizzle with extra herbed oil and serve with lemon wedges.

### Notes
- Lobster meat is done when it’s opaque and firm to the touch.
- Herbed oil can be made ahead: Keeps well in the fridge for up to a few days.
- Serve with sides: Grilled veggies, rice pilaf, or a crisp green salad pair beautifully with lobster.
