The pungent aroma of some pickled daikon & carrots can sometimes clear a room faster than a fire alarm but when added to a great banh mi, it just might be able to bring everyone together again. These pickled jewels add the touch of tang, sweet and sour crunch and flavor to not only banh mi, but to many Vietnamese dishes. Most daikon and carrots found are shredded finely, but when it comes to home made, you can have fun and create just about any shape, size and thickness.

### Ingredients

* `1/2 lb` carrots - shredded in food processor, sliced in thin rounds or thin match-like strips.
* `1/2 lb` daikon radish – cut same as carrots.
* `3 cups` warm water
* `3 tbsp` distilled or rice vinegar
* `2-3 tbsp` sugar, depending on how sweet you want your pickles
* `2 tbsp` salt

### Directions

1. Mix warm water, vinegar, sugar and salt until everything is dissolved. Choose a pitcher or bowl with a lip that can be used for pouring mixture.
2. Peel, wash and cut daikon & carrots to desired size. Combine both together in bowl and blot dry with paper towel.
3. Fill carrot & daikon mixture into a tight lid jar, bowl or similar container.
4. Pour liquid salt mixture into carrot & daikon container till full. Close lid and let it pickle for about 3-5 days, or till desired sourness. For immediate use, let marinade for about 1 hour. 

### Notes

- The longer the pickled carrots and daikon are allowed to pickle, the more sour they become. So plan accordingly and pickle the carrots and daikon ahead of time for your menu planning.
