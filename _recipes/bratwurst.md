### Ingredients

* `10 lbs` pork butts
* `5 level tsp` kosher salt
* `4 heaping tsp` majoram
* `1 level tsp` ground black pepper
* `1 tsp` each of nutmeg and mace

### Alternate Ingredients

The below ingredients are given per kilogram of meat.

* `1kg` pork stomach without fat and skin, or pork shoulder tendons without fat
* `15g` salt
* `1g` nutmeg, grated
* `1g` allspice, ground
* `1g` black pepper, ground
* `1-2g` majoram, powdered
* `1/2g` lemon powder
* `.5-1g` MSG (optional)
* `1-2g` sugar substitute, such as Splenda or Equal (optional)

### Directions

1. Cut the meat into narrow strips. Add salt and spices, mix and grind through the medium grinder plate (2-5 mm). Mix again and knead well, like dough, until the mixture becomes shiny. If cooking sausage immediately, you can add an egg to the mixture. Use your meat grinder attachment to stuff the mixture into 20mm sheep casings or the smallest hog casings you can find.
2. If a stuffer and casings are not available the sausage meat can also be rolled into plastic wrap as follows: stretch a two foot piece of wrap over the counter. Form a long strip of sausage meat on it, roll tight and tie into 4 inch links. Make more rolls to use up all the meat. Without cutting, poach the whole length until the sausages are firm to the touch.
3. To avoid having water seep through the plastic, do not touch or turn the sausages while they are poaching. Let the sausages cool, unwrap and brown quickly in a hot frying pan or on a hot grill. If using the plastic wrap method, you might start with half a recipe. Rolling ten pounds of ground meat into plastic wrap can be tedious work.
