### Ingredients

#### Black Garlic Marinade (Skip this if using pre-marinated black garlic tuna)
* `2 tbsp` neutral oil (canola preferred)
* `1 tsp` soy sauce
* `½ tsp` kosher salt
* `1 tsp` black garlic, mashed to a paste
* `¼ tsp` garlic powder
* `¼ tsp` onion powder
* `½ tsp` dehydrated onion (minced, optional but ideal)
* `1 tsp` brandy vinegar (or red wine vinegar + a pinch of sugar)
* `⅛ tsp` turmeric
* `⅛ tsp` sugar
* `⅛ tsp` ground spice (white pepper or coriander)

#### Tuna Confit
* `1 lb` ahi / yellowfin tuna steak
* Marinade from above (if using)
* `½–¾ cup` extra-virgin olive oil (enough to mostly submerge)

#### Rillettes
* `1–2 tsp` toasted sesame oil (to taste)
* `1–2 tsp` fresh lemon juice
* `2–3` green onions, finely sliced (white + green parts)
* `2–4 tbsp` reserved confit oil

5. Heat water bath to `121°F`.
6. Place tuna in a vacuum bag or zip-top bag with olive oil (tuna should be mostly submerged).
7. Seal and cook for `30 minutes`.
8. Remove tuna and let cool slightly. Reserve the oil, straining before use.
9. Transfer tuna to a bowl and gently flake with two forks. Aim for small chunks, not a paste.

11. Stir in `2–4 tbsp` reserved confit oil until the mixture becomes cohesive and spreadable.
12. Season with black pepper and adjust salt if needed.
