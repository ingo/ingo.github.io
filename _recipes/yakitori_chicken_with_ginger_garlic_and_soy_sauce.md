title: Yakitori Chicken With Ginger, Garlic and Soy Sauce
---
Yakitori is a popular street food in Japan, and this recipe brings that authentic flavor right to your kitchen. Serve it alongside something fresh and green, like a cucumber salad, and a pile of rice.

### Ingredients

* `1 pound` chicken livers, gizzards or boneless thigh meat
* `½ cup` dark soy sauce or tamari
* `¼ cup` mirin
* `2 tablespoons` sake or dry sherry
* `1 tablespoon` brown sugar
* `2` garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
* `½ teaspoon` grated fresh ginger
* Scallions, thinly sliced, for garnish

### Directions

1. Cut chicken into one-inch pieces and place in a shallow dish.
2. In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce or tamari, mirin, sake or sherry, brown sugar, garlic and ginger. Bring to a simmer and cook for 7 minutes, until thickened. Reserve 2 tablespoons sauce for serving. Pour remaining sauce over chicken, cover, and chill for at least one hour (and up to 4 hours).
3. If using wooden or bamboo skewers, soak them in water for one hour. Preheat grill or broiler. Thread chicken pieces onto skewers, and grill or broil, turning halfway, for about 3 minutes for livers, 10 minutes for gizzards and 6 minutes for thighs. Serve drizzled with reserved sauce and garnished with scallions.
