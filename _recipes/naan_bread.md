This is a recipe for naan bread that's fluffy, bubbly and chewy, just as it should be. Nobody will ever mistake this for just another basic flatbread! Perfect for slopping up your favourite Indian curries – yet so good that you'll happily devour it plain, straight out of the skillet.

### Ingredients

* `1 tsp` instant / rapid rise yeast
* `1/2 cup` warm tap water (~40°C/105°F in temperature)
* `1 tbsp` white sugar
* `2 tbsp` milk , full fat (low fat ok too)
* `1 1/2 tbsp` whisked egg , at room temp (around 1/2 an egg)
* `1/2 tsp` salt , cooking / kosher
* `1 3/4 cups` bread flour , or all-purpose/plain
* `30g / 2 tbsp` ghee or unsalted butter , melted

#### Finishes:

* `30g / 2 tbsp` ghee or butter , melted
* `1` small garlic clove , for Garlic Butter option
* Nigella seeds
* Coriander/cilantro , finely chopped

#### Cheese Naan:

* Shredded cheese (for cheese naan) – Monterey Jack, cheddar, tasty, colby, anything that melts (shred yourself)

### Directions

1. Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap, leave for 10 minutes until foamy.
2. Whisk milk and egg together.
3. Sift flour and salt into a separate bowl.
4. Make a well in the flour, add yeast mixture, and butter and egg mixture. Mix together with a spatula. Once the flour is mostly incorporated, switch to your hands and bring it together into a ball. No kneading is required.
5. Cover the bowl with cling-wrap, then leave in a warm place for 1 – 1.5 hrs until it doubles in size.
6. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces, then shape into balls into spheres with a smooth surface by stretching the surface and tucking it under.
7. Place balls on a lightly-floured tray or plate. Sprinkle lightly with flour, cover loosely with a lightweight tea towel. Put in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes until it increases in size by about 50%.
8. Place a round on a lightly-floured work surface, flatten with your hand. Roll out into 3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16" thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5" wide).
9. Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using 1/2 tsp oil on a paper towl (unless already well seasoned). Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke.
10. Place a naan dough in the skillet and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until the underside is deep golden / slightly charred – the surface should get bubbly. Flip then cook the other side for 1 minute until the bubbles become deep golden brown.
11. Remove, set aside, and repeat with remaining naan, taking care to regulate the heat of the skillet so it doesn't get too hot.
12. Brush freshly cooked naan with melted butter or ghee (or garlic butter). Sprinkle with nigella seeds and coriander. Serve hot!

### Cheese Naan:

1. Roll out a naan per above directions. Brush with plain butter or garlic butter. Place a mound of cheese in the middle – about 1/4 cup, lightly-packed. Bundle it up, money bag-style, then twist to seal.
2. Turn upside down so the smooth side is up. Roll out to 6-7mm / 1/4" thick rounds.
3. Heat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet preheated over high heat, but not until the skillet is smoking. Cook naan for around 1 1/2 minutes on the first side until golden – it will puff up! Turn and cook the other side for around 45 seconds.
