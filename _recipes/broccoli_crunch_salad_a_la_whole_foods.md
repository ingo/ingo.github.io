### Ingredients

* `4 cups` Broccoli florets
* `1/2 cup` Mayonnaise
* `2 tbsp` Cider Vinegar
* `1 tbsp` granulated Sugar
* Kosher Salt and Black Pepper
* `1/4 cup` Golden Raisins
* `1/2 cup` Candied Cashews (recipe follows)
* `3 slices` Bacon, diced
* `2 tbsp` minced Red Onion

### Directions

1. Steam broccoli for 2 minutes, then shock in an ice bath. Drain and lay out on paper towels for any remaining water to drain off while you’re getting the rest of the salad together. 
2. Whisk together mayonnaise, vinegar and sugar. Add a little salt and pepper. 
3. Cook bacon in a pan until crisp, drain on paper towels. Crumble it up. 
4. When you’re ready to assemble it, toss broccoli, raisins, candied cashews, bacon and red onion with dressing. Taste and adjust salt and pepper if needed. Chill for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

### Candied Cashews

* `1 cup` roasted cashews
* `1/4 cup` sugar
* `1/2 tsp` ground coriander
* `1/4 tsp` ground cinnamon
* `1/8 tsp` ground allspice
* pinch cayenne
* `1/2 tsp` kosher salt (if your cashews are already salted, skip this or reduce to just a pinch or so)

1. In a large stainless-steel skillet, combine cashews, sugar and 2 tbsp water. Bring water to a boil over high heat. Lower heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until water evaporates and sugar crystallizes around nuts, about 5 minutes.
2. In a small bowl, combine coriander, cinnamon, allspice, cayenne, and coarse salt. Stir into nuts and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until sugar begins to melt and caramelize, 1-2 minutes. The line between perfect and burnt occurs very quickly. Stand by and be ready to get he nuts out of the pan. 
3. Spread out on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cool to room temperature before serving, about 5 minutes. Use 1/2 cup in the salad and the rest for snacking.

### Notes

* You may need to break up some of the nuts, because they may solidify a bit like brittle in places.
