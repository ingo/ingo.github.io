title: Pan-Roasted Chicken Cipollini
---

It's very easy to do, relatively quick to prepare, and requires only a single pan. We use cipollini onions, but shallots work just as well. You can use any mushrooms you like for the recipe. We've tried crimini, shitaki, and chanterelles.

### Ingredients

* `1` shallot
* `1/2` split chicken breasts (skin on)
* `1-2 cups` mushrooms, cleaned and cut into halves or quarters, depending on the size
* `1 1/2 cups` cipollini onions or shallots, brushed of dirt and cut in half crosswise
* `1 tbsp` chopped rosemary or thyme
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `1/4 cup` chicken stock
* `2 tsp` Dijon mustard
* `to taste` salt
* `to taste` pepper

### Directions

1. If you have time, brine the chicken breasts in advance. This is unnecessary if they are Kosher chicken breasts, as they are already reasonably seasoned from the Koshering process. Heat the oven to 350 F. Wash and dry the chicken breast, seasoning both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Heat a heavy 10-12" ovenproof skillet on medium heat . Add 1 tbsp. of the oil and place the chicken breasts skin-side down in the pan. Meanwhile, toss the mushrooms, onions and herbs with the remaining oil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Once the chicken breasts have turned light gold on the bottom, distribute the onion-mushroom mixture evenly around the pan. Place in the oven and cook 20-30 minutes or until the chicken breasts register 160 F using an instant-read thermometer.
3. Carefully remove the pan from the oven, empty the contents into a covered container, and pour of most of the extra oil. Heat the pan over the stove and pour in the chicken stock, scraping the pan bottom to loosen the caramelized bits. Once the chicken stock is simmering, whisk in the Dijon mustard and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Plate the chicken breast with the onion-mushroom mixture and pour the sauce over the top.

### Notes

- If changing mushrooms, you may wish to alter the fresh herbs to suit. Rosemary can overpower chanterelles, so thyme might be more appropriate.
