description: This classic dish is often referred to as Murgh Makhani; here, the point
  is to smother good grilled chicken in a rich sauce. The dish was created as a way
  to keep cooked/leftover tandoori chicken from drying out.

### Ingredients

* For the chicken
* `1 1/2 pounds` boneless, skinless chicken (white and/or dark meat), cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
* `1 tbsp` fresh lime juice
* `1 tsp` Kashmiri chile powder (may substitute a combination of 2/3 teaspoons paprika and 1/3 teaspoon cayenne pepper)
* `2 tsp` garam masala
* `1 1/2 tsp` salt
* `1/4 cup` plain, full-fat yogurt
* `1 tbsp` minced garlic
* `1 tbsp` finely minced fresh ginger root
* For the sauce
* `2 tbsp` canola or vegetable oil
* `1` yellow onion, finely chopped
* `4` medium tomatoes, hulled and chopped
* `1 tsp` minced garlic
* `2 tsp` peeled minced fresh ginger root
* `1 tbsp` bright red chili powder, such as Kashmiri chili powder (may substitute a combination of chili powder and paprika; see headnote)
* `1 tbsp` garam masala
* `1 tsp` ground cumin
* `2 tbsp` salted butter
* `1/3 cup` heavy cream

### Directions

1. For the chicken: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a rimmed baking sheet with cooking oil spray.
2. Combine the chicken meat with lime juice, chili powder, garam masala, salt, yogurt, garlic and ginger in a mixing bowl, then spread evenly over the baking sheet. Roast (middle rack) for 15 to 18 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked through.
3. Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat the oil in a pot over medium heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and cook for 2 or 3 minutes, until softened. Stir in the tomato; cook for 10 to 12 minutes.
4. Use a spatula to press the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer back into the pot, or puree with an immersion (stick) blender right in the pot. Stir in the garlic, ginger, chile powder, garam masala and cumin until well blended, then add the chicken, stirring to coat it with sauce. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, just until heated through.
5. Just before serving, add the butter. Once it has melted, stir in the cream, until well incorporated. Immediately remove from the heat; serve warm.

### Notes

The dish tastes even better after a day's refrigeration; you may need to add a little cream or water to thin the sauce, which will thicken once it's chilled. Kashmiri chile powder is bright-tasting and lends a beautiful color to this dish; you can find it at Indian markets and at Bazaar Spices in the District's Union Market.
