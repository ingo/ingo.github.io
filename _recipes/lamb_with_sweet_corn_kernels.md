### Ingredients

* `1/2` medium onion, coarsely chopped
* `3` cloves garlic
* Small amount of neutral oil
* `1-1/2 TB` ghee
* `3` cloves
* `2` cardamom pods
* `1` cinnamon stick
* `1` bay leaf
* `1 lb.` lamb stew meat
* `1/4 c.` plain yogurt
* `1 tsp.` Indian chili powder
* `1-1/2 tsp.` ground coriander
* `1/2 tsp.` ground turmeric
* `1/2 tsp.` cumin seeds
* Salt
* `1-1/4 c.` water
* Kernels removed from `2` ears of sweet corn, then roughly puréed
* `1-1/2 tsp.` green chilies, de-seeded and chopped fine
* `1-1/2 tsp.` sugar
* `1/2 c.` milk
* `2 TB` chickpea flour
* Juice of `1` lime
* Chopped cilantro

### Directions

1. Cook onion and garlic in a small amount of oil in a small skillet until slightly browned. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a blender or mini food processor. Pureé with a small amount of water or yogurt. Set aside.
2. Heat ghee in a large pan or Dutch oven. Add cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and bay leaf and fry for a couple of minutes, stirring, until fragrant. Add meat, yogurt, remaining dried spices and onion/garlic paste. Season with salt. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes.
3. Add water and stir. Cover and simmer for about 1-1/2 hours, until meat is nearly done.
4. Add corn kernels, chilies, sugar, milk and chickpea flour. Stir well. Cook for about 15 or 20 minutes more, stirring frequently, so that corn doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.
5. Add lime juice, cilantro and (if needed) additional salt.
