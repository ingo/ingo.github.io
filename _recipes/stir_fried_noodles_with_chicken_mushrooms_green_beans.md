title: Stir-Fried Noodles with Chicken, Mushrooms & Green Beans
---
This stir-fry recipe is perfect for those who want to enjoy a vibrant and fresh meal without needing to stock up on exotic ingredients. You don't even need a wok - a skillet or stir-fry pan will do the trick!

### Ingredients

* `4 oz` wide (pad thai) rice noodles
* `4 oz` green beans, cut on the diagonal into 1/4-inch-thick slices (to yield 1 cup)
* `1 Tbs` vegetable oil
* `1 Tbs` minced garlic
* `1` boneless, skinless chicken breast half (6 to 7 oz.), cut in half lengthwise and then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices (to yield 3/4 cup)
* `1/2 tsp` kosher salt
* `2 Tbs` fish sauce
* `1 Tbs` minced fresh ginger
* `1 Tbs` granulated sugar
* `1 tsp` minced red or green serrano chile
* `2 oz` white or cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced (to yield 1 cup)
* `1 tsp` (or more) chicken broth or water, if needed
* `1/4 cup` roughly chopped fresh basil
* `2 Tbs` roughly chopped fresh mint leaves
* `1` lime, cut into wedges for serving

### Directions

1. Submerge wide (pad thai) rice noodles in a bowl of very warm (110°F) water and soak until they’re pliable but still rather firm, about 30 minutes. Drain in a colander (no need to pat dry).
2. Meanwhile, prep the rest of the ingredients.
3. Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and blanch until crisp-tender, 30 to 60 seconds. Drain in a colander and run under cold water to stop the cooking.
4. Once the noodles are drained, heat the oil in a large (12-inch) skillet or stir-fry pan over high heat until very hot. Add the garlic, stir, and immediately add the chicken. Season with the salt and stir-fry until the chicken is partially cooked, 1 to 2 min. Add the fish sauce, ginger, sugar, and chile and stir to combine. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry until they’re limp, 1 to 2 min. Add the blanched green beans and noodles and stir-fry until the noodles are tender, about 1 min. If they’re too firm, add 1 Tbs. of broth or water and stir-fry until the liquid is absorbed and the noodles are tender, about 1 min. Transfer to a platter or plates, and garnish with the basil and mint. Serve immediately, with lime wedges on the side.
