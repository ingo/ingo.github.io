### Ingredients

* `2 1/2 cups` cake flour (all-purpose is fine)
* `2` heaping teaspoons baking powder
* `2 teaspoons` baking soda
* `1` big pinch salt
* `2` eggs, beaten
* `2 1/2 cups` buttermilk, at room temperature (if you donâ€™t have buttermilk, use 2 1/2 cups regular milk, and add 2 tbsp vinegar to it. Let sit 15 mins)
* `1/4 cup` sugar
* `1 teaspoon` vanilla extract
* `1/2 cup` melted butter or oil, at room temperature, plus extra for griddle

### Directions

1. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Whisk together the flour mixture, beaten eggs, buttermilk, sugar, vanilla, and melted butter until they are very smooth. Let the batter sit for 5 minutes before using it.
2. Preheat an electric griddle to 375 degrees, or place a nonstick griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Just before cooking the pancakes, coat the cooking surface with melted butter using a pastry brush.
3. Scoop up batter in a half-cup measuring cup, filling it to the top. Pour batter onto hot griddle, letting it spread by itself into a circle about 5 inches in diameter. Repeat with remaining batter (possibly in batches) until a dozen pancakes or so are formed.
4. Flip the pancakes when their edges appear to be hardening a little; there should also be many small holes opening up on the surface of the pancakes. This should take about 2 minutes. Cook the pancakes on the other side for about 2 minutes more, or until the pancakes are golden brown and cooked through.

### Notes

- When cooking the pancakes in batches, hold them in a warm oven covered with a damp cloth. Also, remember to reheat and butter the griddle after each round of pancake cooking.
