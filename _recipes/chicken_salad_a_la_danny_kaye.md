This recipe not only gives you a delicious chicken salad but also teaches you the methodology for Cold Poaching a whole chicken for Chinese Ginger Chicken.

### Ingredients

#### Chicken:

* `1` chicken, about 3 ½ #
* `½` sliced carrot
* `1` small leek, washed and left whole
* `1` rib celery, washed and left whole
* `1 tsp` salt
* `¼ tsp` black peppercorns
* `2` sprigs thyme
* `2` bay leaves
* `7 cups` warm water, enough to cover the chicken

#### Dressing:

* `2 tbsp` Dijon mustard
* `1 tbsp` white wine vinegar
* `1 tsp` finely chopped garlic
* `¼ tsp` salt
* `¼ tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `½ tsp` Tabasco
* `5 tbsp` extra-virgin olive oil

#### Garnishes:

* `1 dozen` Boston lettuce leaves
* `2 dozen` fresh tarragon leaves

### Directions

1. Place the chicken in a narrow pot, breast side down. Add remaining ingredients. Water should come about 1” above the chicken. Bring to a gentle boil and boil for 5 minutes, covered. Remove from heat and let it sit in the hot broth for 30 minutes (until breast reaches 165).
2. For Chinese Cold Poached Chicken, chop the chicken into 2” pieces.
3. For the salad recipe, let chicken cool on a platter and then shred meat from bones, discarding fat, skin and bones.
4. Mix the dressing ingredients in a bowl large enough to hold the chicken also. Add chicken shreds to dressing, toss gently. Place chicken on top of the lettuce leaves, either on a platter or on individual (4) plates and top with the tarragon leaves.

### Notes

Save the chicken stock for later use.
