title: Slow-Cooker Butter Chicken
category: Entrees 
description: Not every version of butter chicken uses butter. Coconut milk gives this slow-cooker chicken its creamy richness. This is a fast recipe for the cook. Just prep it earlier in the day, even during your morning routine, getting your onion and spices going on the stove while simultaneously making lunches for grumpy children, folding dish towels, feeding the dogs and wondering once again why no one else has done any of the above.

### Ingredients

* `3 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `1` medium yellow onion, diced
* `3 cloves` garlic, finely chopped
* `3 tbsp` grated ginger
* `1 tbsp` garam masala
* `1 6-ounce can` tomato paste
* `¾ tsp` kosher salt
* `3 lbs` boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 2-inch pieces
* `1 tsp` lime zest
* `1 tbsp` lime juice
* `1 cup` coconut milk (if necessary, whisk to combine the liquid and solids before measuring)
* `½ cup` chicken stock
* `¼ cup` cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)
* Cooked basmati or jasmine rice, for serving
* Naan, for serving (optional)

### Directions

1. In medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions to skillet, and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and ginger, and cook another 2 minutes. Add garam masala, tomato paste and salt; cook and stir 2 minutes.
2. Place chicken pieces in a slow cooker, then add tomato paste mixture, lime zest and juice, coconut milk and chicken stock. Stir everything together, cover and cook on low heat setting for 4 1/2 to 5 hours, until the chicken is cooked through. (You may let it cook up to 7 hours if necessary, but the chicken may be very soft and shred.) Garnish with cilantro and serve with basmati or jasmine rice, and naan if you have some.
