description: This is a very old and incredibly easy method of preserving fresh fruit
  by coating it in granulated sugar. If you love fruit preserves with bright, fresh
  fruit flavor, but are not ready to commit to the process of canning at home--try
  this technique, there's no cooking involved. The resulting sugared fruit can keep
  for several months stored in the refrigerator.

### Ingredients

* `3 cups` fresh blackberries, sliced peaches, or other fruit
* `2-3 cups` granulated sugar
* `1/2 teaspoon` kosher salt
* `juice of 1/2` lemon or lime (optional)

### Directions

1. Place the fruit, 2 cups of sugar and salt into a bowl and mash together (a fork, spoon, potato masher or other implement works well) until you reach the desired consistency. It will thin a little as the juice leeches from the fruit due to the sugar.
2. Add lemon or lime juice and more sugar as desired.
3. Place in an airtight container and refrigerate, stirring once or twice in the next day or two. It will keep for at least a month refrigerated.
