title: Baked Beans with Buttered Toast
---

While associated with an English breakfast, this dish
  became a favorite of Ingo's while living in London. The beans lend themselves wonderfully
  to being piled on toast. The beans are flavored with onions, garlic, mustard and
  brown sugar as they bake low and slow until tender. Serving them atop a slice of
  toasted bread adds texture and soaks up the sauce.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` baked beans
* `2 slices` white bread
* butter
* Poached Sunny Side Up Eggs

### Directions

1. Heat the beans. Toast the bread and spread with butter. Place eggs on place, place beans on side, and add bread.
2. Dish is best eaten when eggs are broken, and eggs and beans are sopped up with bread.
