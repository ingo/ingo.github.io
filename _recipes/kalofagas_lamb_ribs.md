This versatile dish can be prepared in the oven or on the grill, and is sure to be a hit at any gathering. Lamb ribs, the top half of the rack usually sliced off when the butcher makes rack of lamb or chops, are a delicious and finger-licking meze or appetizer.

### Ingredients

* `4` racks of lamb ribs
* Yellow mustard
* `1 tbsp` onion powder
* `1 tbsp` garlic powder
* `2 tbsp` lemon pepper
* `1 tsp` ground bay
* `2 tsp` ground allspice
* `2 tsp` dry thyme
* `1 tbsp` fine sea salt
* `2 tbsp` sweet paprika
* Pre-heated 350F oven

### Directions

1. Remove any excess fat from the ribs and using a small knife, loosen the silver skin from the underside of the ribs and pull it off and discard. You may have to also pull off a fatty cap that covers the top of the lamb rack (thereâ€™s still plenty of meat underneath).
2. Mix all the above ingredients in a jar and stir to mix the contents well. Squirt some mustard on both sides and brush to spread evenly.
3. Rub the ribs with seasoning and work it in with your fingers. Allow the rub to penetrate the ribs in the fridge for 3 hours or 1 hour room temperature.
4. Allow the ribs to return to room temperature and place on a baking tray. Cover the ribs with aluminum foil and place in your preheated oven and roast for 2 hours. Take out of the oven and test the meat by inserting a knife. If still not tender, place back in the oven and test for doneness in 30 minute intervals.
5. Remove the aluminum foil and cook uncovered for another 30 minutes or until browned and just crisp.
6. Take out of the oven and tent with foil for 10 minutes. Cut the ribs and serve with fresh squeezed lemon juice, sprinkle of sea salt and dried Greek oregano as garnish.
7. Serve lamb ribs with a side of homemade [Tzatziki sauce](https://www.kalofagas.ca/2010/02/01/tzatziki/).

### Notes

- For a BBQ version, place the ribs on your grill, using indirect heat method for 2-3 hours (drip pan underneath to catch fat) and finish on direct heat.
