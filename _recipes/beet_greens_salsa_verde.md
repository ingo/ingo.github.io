title: Beet Greens Salsa Verde
---

Pepitas, olive oil, garlic, lemon and capers round out the flavor. It's delicious spooned over grilled meats, fish, sandwiches, pizza, vegetables and more.
  
### Ingredients

* `1 cup` beet greens (not the stems!)
* `¼ cup` cilantro
* `¼ cup` parsley
* `1` tomatillo
* `1` large avocado
* `1 tsp` white vinegar (maybe lime instead?)
* `1 clove` garlic
* `1/3 cup` Olive oil

### Directions

1. Puree the tomatillo and the garlic clove in a food processor
2. Blanch the beet greens for 1 minute, and shock in ice water. Squeeze out excess water.
3. Combine the rest of the ingredients (except the avocado) in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. This should not be a puree texture, but instead grainy/leafy.
4. Chop the avocado into small chunks. Fold into salsa.
