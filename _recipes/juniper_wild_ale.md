This beer began as pure experiment. It has become an obsession. The entire reason I started brewing beer is to incorporate foraged elements into the brew. Mostly this means adding either wild adjunct grains, like wild rice, or botanical additions that contribute flavor. I do this with fresh, green fir tips in my fir tip ale, and with juniper berries in my NorCal gose beer.

### Ingredients

* `3.15 pounds` Maris Otter extract
* `1.25 pounds` rye malt extract
* `1 pound` dry light extract
* `4 ounces` Special B malt
* `28 grams` Fuggles hops, added at 60 minutes to go in the boil
* `1` Whirlfloc tablet, added at 10 minutes to go (helps clarify beer)
* `60 grams` juniper berries, half added with 5 minutes to go, half added at knockout
* `58 grams` chopped pine needles, added at knockout
* `1 quart` juniper starter
* `1 ounce` oak chips, boiled for 1 minute first
* `6 teaspoons` 88% Lactic acid (optional)

### Directions

1. Steep the Special B malt. Put the malt into a grain bag or tie it up loosely in cheesecloth and cover it with 3 quarts of water. Bring this to 155°F to 165°F over medium heat and hold it at this temperature for 1 hour. Remove the bag and set it over the pot in a strainer. Pour 2 quarts of water heated to 170°F over it to rinse the grain. Let the bag drain for 10 minutes, then remove. Discard the grain or feed it to animals.
2. Start the boil. Add 2 more gallons of water to the pot and bring this to a boil. Add the hops and set the timer for 1 hour.
3. With 30 minutes to go, add all the extracts and stir well.
4. If you are using it, add the Whirlfloc to the boil along with the wort chiller, if you have one. This will sanitize the chiller.
5. With 5 minutes to go, add half the juniper berries.
6. Knockout. Turn off the heat and add the final addition of juniper berries along with the chopped pine needles.
7. Crash chill the wort. Use your wort chiller to chill the wort back to 75°F or cooler, depending on how warm your tap water is. Or, put the pot in a cooler with lots of ice water in it. Use a clean spoon to create a whirlpool in the wort, which will help it chill faster. Hopefully you will see gnarly bits in the wort that look like egg drop soup, or separating miso in soup: That's cold crash trub, and seeing it means you will have a clearer beer.
8. Move the wort to the fermentor. Add the juniper yeast starter to the fermentor; I use a glass carboy. Pour the contents of the pot through a sanitized strainer into the fermentor. If the strainer gets all gunked up with trub, remove it before continuing. Put a sanitized airlock on the fermentor and put the beer in a place where it can ferment cool, ideally 66°F to 69°F. Leave it there for 2 weeks.
9. Add the boiled oak chips to a new sanitized carboy and rack the beer into it. I do this only if there is a lot of crud in the fermentor. If it's OK, I just add the oak chips to the primary fermentor. Either way, let the beer finish fermenting for 10 more days.
10. Bottle or keg the beer. If you are bottling, you want to add enough priming sugar to the batch to get about 2 volumes of CO2, about 1.8 ounces or 51 grams for 3 gallons. Add the lactic acid to the bottling bucket. Bottle condition the ale 2 weeks before opening the first bottle. This beer ages well.

### Notes

Estimated Alcohol by Volume (ABV): 5.4%
IBUs: 25, but the pine needles and juniper berries will add additional hoplike bitterness and aromas
Original Gravity and Final Gravity: 1.055, going down to 1.016

To Make the Yeast Starter:
Boil about 3 cups malt extract (I used light dry malt extract), then cool it to about 85°F.
Drop in a handful of foraged juniper berries, dry or fresh (Not sure if store-bought have yeast on them still)
Cover whatever container you are using. If a Mason jar, screw on the lid just barely.
Put in a cool, dark place and check it every day. Shake it around. In two to four days, you should see yeast activity.
