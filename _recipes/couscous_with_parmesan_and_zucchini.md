title: Couscous with Parmesan and Zucchini
category: Sides
description: Couscous is a simple, fast-cooking grain that goes particularly well with Middle-Eastern dishes like lamb. Often, we'll cook couscous, saut√© some vegetables and toss the vegetables and couscous with some herbs, and cheese. This is one of the more successful combinations we've made.

### Ingredients

* `2 tsp` olive oil
* `1 cup` "instant" couscous
* `1` zucchini, diced
* `1/2` red or yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced
* `1/4 cup` Parmesan, cubed into 1/8 squares
* `1 tsp` chopped thyme
* `1 tsp` chopped parsley

### Directions

1. Prepare the couscous as directed and keep warm. One traditional method is to heat 1 cup water with 1 tsp. butter and a little salt in a pan until boiling, remove from heat, add the dry couscous and cover for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a pan and sweat the zucchini and bell pepper with salt and pepper over low heat, trying not to brown the vegetables. Once tender, remove from heat. Stir the vegetables, cheese and herbs into the prepared couscous and adjust seasonings. You may wish to drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil in at the end if the salad tastes a little dry.
