Finished with a touch of toasted sesame oil for nutty flavor and garnished with minced garlic chips. A simple, delicious side dish. Baby bok choy has a milder flavor than full grown. Braising gently in broth keeps it bright green and enhances natural sweetness. A kiss of sesame oil and garlic chips give it some crunch.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` chicken broth
* `3 tbsp` unsalted butter
* `¾ lb` baby bok choy, trimmed
* `½ tsp` Asian sesame oil

### Directions

1. Bring broth and butter to a simmer in a deep large heavy skillet. Arrange bok choy evenly in skillet and simmer, covered, until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer bok choy with tongs to a serving dish and keep warm, covered.
2. Boil broth mixture until reduced to about 1/4 cup, then stir in sesame oil and pepper to taste. Pour mixture over bok choy.
