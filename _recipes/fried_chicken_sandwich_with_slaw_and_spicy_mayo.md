category: Entrees
description: If your idea of coleslaw is the pleated paper cup of shredded stuff alongside BLTs at the diner, it's time for a new rule. Slaw doesn't go with the sandwich, it goes on the sandwich. Slaws deliver on several fronts. They're crunchy, and sandwiches need crunch. Done right, slaws give a bright acidic kick to counter the fatty goodness of meats and mayo. And they provide a temperature contrast to warm sandwiches, like this fried-chicken masterpiece from Son of a Gun in Los Angeles. We can't think of a sandwich that doesn't deserve slaw, so pile it on.

### Ingredients

**Spicy mayo and slaw:**

* `1` garlic clove, finely grated
* `1/2 cup` mayonnaise
* `1 tbsp` Louisiana-style hot pepper sauce
* `1/2` small red onion, thinly sliced
* `1` jalapeño, thinly sliced
* `4 cups` thinly sliced cabbage
* `1/2 cup` bread-and-butter pickle slices, plus `1/4 cup` pickle juice

**Fried chicken and assembly:**

* `2 cups` all-purpose flour
* `1 tbsp` ground black pepper
* `1/2 tsp` kosher salt plus more
* `1 cup` buttermilk
* `2` 8-ounces skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved crosswise
* Peanut or vegetable oil (for frying)
* `4` white sandwich rolls
* `2 tbsp` unsalted butter, room temperature

### Directions

**For spicy mayo and slaw:**

1. Mix garlic, mayonnaise, and hot pepper sauce in a small bowl; cover and chill. 
2. Toss onion, jalapeño, cabbage, pickles, and pickle juice in a large bowl to combine; cover and chill. 

**For fried chicken and assembly:**

1. Whisk flour, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a shallow bowl. Pour buttermilk into another shallow bowl. Working with 1 piece at a time, dredge chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. Dip in buttermilk, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Dredge again in flour mixture, shaking off excess. 
2. Pour oil into a large heavy skillet to a depth of 1/2". Prop deep-fry thermometer in oil so bulb is submerged. Heat over medium heat until thermometer registers 350°F. 
3. Fry chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet; season with salt. Spread cut sides of rolls with butter. Heat another large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, cook rolls buttered side down until browned and crisp, about 1 minute. 
4. Spread with spicy mayo. Build sandwiches with rolls, chicken, and cabbage slaw.
