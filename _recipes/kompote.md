In Russia, it's made with apples, pears, plums, and berries. Compared to juice, it's a bit thicker and reminiscent of the fruit that made it, but not as forceful a taste.

### Ingredients

* `1-2 cups` sugar
* Water
* Fruit to taste. A sample ingredient list might be:
* `4` apples
* `4` plums (red or black preferred--they give better color)
* `2` nectarines
* `2` peaches
* A handful of berries, or a few tablespoons berry jam (optional, for color)

### Directions

1. Fill a 4 quart pot approximately 3/4 full with water. Peel and core the apples and pears. Cut the fruit into bite-sized pieces. Bring water to a boil. Add 1-2 cups of sugar, depending on how sweet you would like it, and how sweet the fruit is. You can always add more sugar later. Stir sugar to dissolve. Add apples and pears to water. Bring back to a boil. Add the rest of the fruits, except for berries. Bring back to a boil. Add berries or jam, if using.
2. Turn heat off.
3. Cool to room temperature. You can serve at room temperature or cooled, with or without the fruit, as desired.

### Notes

- To make with dried fruits, use approximately the same amount of dried fruit as fresh.
