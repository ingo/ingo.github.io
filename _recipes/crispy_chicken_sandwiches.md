### Ingredients

Crispy Chicken

* `2` chicken breasts, cut in half widthwise to make 4 thin ones
* sour cream marinade \(below\)
* `½-1 cup` homemade shake ‘n bake\*

Sour Cream Marinade

* `¼ cup` sour cream
* `½ tbsp` minced chives
* `½ tbsp` lemon juice
* `½ tsp` paprika
* `½ tsp` worcestershire sauce
* `1` small garlic clove, minced

Quick Aioli

* `½ cup` mayonnaise
* `1` garlic clove, minced
* `1 tbsp` lemon juice
* salt and pepper, to taste

To Serve

* `4` ciabatta rolls \(or other\), split
* lettuce, tomatoes, cheese

### Directions

1. Mix together ingredients for the sour cream marinade. Place chicken in the marinade, making sure each piece is coated evenly. Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 400ºF while you prepare the rest of the meal.
2. Stir together aioli ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
3. Coat marinated chicken pieces in homemade shake ‘n bake. Place on a baking sheet. Bake for 10\-15 minutes or until cooked through.
4. Serve on rolls spread with aioli and topped with lettuce, sliced tomatoes and cheese.

### Notes

* For extra crispiness, bake the chicken on an oven proof cooling rack so the air can circulate under the chicken as well.
