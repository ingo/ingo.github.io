The Roasted Chicken with Clementines & Arak is a favorite recipe from Ottolenghi. The chicken is lavished with intense flavors—arak, mustard, fennel, clementines with their skins, and brown sugar—that come together to create a sweetly comforting dish. This dish is perfect for those who enjoy a meal that is both comforting and full of flavor.

### Ingredients

- `7 tablespoons` arak, ouzo, or Pernod` (a scant 1/2 cup)
- `4 tablespoons` olive oil
- `3 tablespoons` freshly squeezed orange juice
- `3 tablespoons` lemon juice
- `2 tablespoons` grain mustard
- `3 tablespoons` light brown sugar
- `2 medium` fennel bulbs (about `1.1 lb total`), trimmed
- `1 large` organic or free-range chicken, about `3 lb`, divided into 8 pieces  
  *(or the same weight in chicken thighs with skin on and bone-in)*
- `4 clementines`, unpeeled (about `14 oz total`), sliced horizontally into 1/4-inch rounds
- `1 tablespoon` fresh thyme leaves
- `2 1/2 teaspoons` fennel seeds, lightly crushed
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish

### Directions

1. Put the first six ingredients in a large mixing bowl and add `2 1/2 teaspoons salt` and `1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper`. Whisk well and set aside.
2. Trim the fennel and cut each bulb in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Add the fennel to the liquids, along with the chicken pieces, clementine slices, thyme, and fennel seeds. Mix well with your hands, then leave to marinate in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight (this step can be skipped if short on time).
3. Preheat the oven to `425°F`. Transfer the chicken and its marinade to a large baking dish or rimmed sheet pan, arranging everything in a single layer with the chicken skin-side up. Roast for `35–45 minutes`, until the chicken is golden and cooked through. Remove from the oven.
4. Lift the chicken, fennel, and clementines onto a serving platter and keep warm. Pour the cooking juices into a small saucepan, bring to a boil, then simmer until reduced by about one-third (to roughly `1/3 cup`). Spoon the hot sauce over the chicken, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve.

### Notes

- Serve with plainly cooked rice or bulgur.
- If pressed for time, the marinating step can be skipped.
