This recipe for Whole Dungeness Crab Roasted in Garlic Sauce, also known as Killer Crab, is a specialty of chef Andrea Froncillo. It's a savory seafood dish that will surely impress your guests.

### Ingredients

* `2` whole crabs (2 plus pounds each)
* Crab butter
* Crab innards (optional)
* `1/2 cup` white wine
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `1` chopped medium shallot
* `1/2 sprig` rosemary (chopped)
* `1 sprig` thyme, leaves chopped
* `2 tbsp` Szechwan peppercorns
* `1/2 cup` canola oil
* `1 tbsp` garlic salt
* `8 to 10` garlic cloves, roasted and pureed
* Chopped parsley, for garnish

### Directions

1. Depending on where you get the crabs they could be alive or preboiled. If they're alive, place the crabs in boiling water for 5 minutes (until red in color). Remove from pot and cool them in iced water (quick cool). With your thumb and index finger pry open the head, remove innards and save. Under running water wipe clean the head area.

2. In a blender add the innards with 1/4 cup of white wine, blend on pulse, strain, and save.

3. In a pot on medium heat add olive oil, shallots, rosemary, thyme, and peppercorns. Cook until light brown, about 5 minutes. Deglaze with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of wine. Add the blended crab innards, the canola oil, and the garlic salt. Simmer for 10 minutes. Skim the top, remove from the heat and cool for a few minutes. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Whisk in the garlic puree and let rest.

4. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

5. Place the 2 crabs in a large oven-proof skillet, ladle the crab butter over them, (be generous) and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Set the crabs on your serving dish, sprinkle with garlic salt, put the empty head shells back on (you can brush the shell with olive oil to shine) sprinkle. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
