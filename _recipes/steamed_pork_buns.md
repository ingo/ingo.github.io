### Ingredients

#### Sauce
* `2 tsp` oyster sauce
* `3/4 tsp` dark soy sauce
* `2 tsp` ketchup
* `1 1/2 tsp` sugar
* `pinch` white pepper
* `3 tbsp` Chicken Broth
* `1/2 tsp` sesame oil

#### Remaining
* `2 tsp` peanut oil
* `1/3 cup` diced onions
* `1/2 cup` diced roast pork (roast turkey also works well here)
* `1 tsp` Shoa-Hsing wine or sherry
* `1` recipe Steamed Bun Dough
* parchment paper

### Directions

1. Combine all sauce ingredients. Heat wok over high heat for 30 seconds. Add peanut oil and coat wok. When smoke appears, add onions, lower heat to low, and cook until onions turn light brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add roast pork, raise heat, and stir fry 1 minute. Add wine.
2. Lower heat and add sauce mixture to pork. Stir until well mixed. Turn off heat and transfer to shallow dish. Cool and then refrigerate until cold.
3. To prepare buns: Cut 8 2 1/2 squares of parchment paper. Roll dough into log and cut into 8 equal-size pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, covering pieces not being worked with a damp cloth.
4. Using fingers, press dough into domelike shape. Place 1 tbsp. filling in center of well. Gather the dough, close around filling, and pleat with fingers. Twist and break off the top so that package is sealed.
5. Place each bun on a square of parchment paper, pleated side up. Place in steamer, 2 inches apart. Steam 15-20 minutes over hot water.
