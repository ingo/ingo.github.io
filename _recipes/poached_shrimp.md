Perfect for a raw shellfish bar. This recipe for poached shrimp is a courtesy of Tyler Florence. It's an easy and quick dish that is perfect for a seafood feast.

### Ingredients

* `2 tsp` sea salt
* `2` lemons, halved, plus more for serving
* `3` bay leaves
* `1 handful` fresh thyme leaves
* `1 handful` fresh flat-leaf parsley
* `1/4 cup` seafood seasoning (recommended: Old Bay or Zatarains shrimp boil)
* `2 pounds` jumbo shrimp, with shells, heads, and tails on

### Directions

Traditional stovetop method:

1. Fill a large pot with about a 1/2 gallon of water, add the salt and squeeze in the lemon juice; toss the halves in there too for extra flavor. Add the herbs and seafood seasoning.
2. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and simmer for 5 minutes to infuse the water with the aromatics.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low and add shrimp. Simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the shrimp are bright pink and the tails curl.
4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp from the poaching liquid and chill thoroughly before peeling.
5. Serve with lemon wedges and Bloody Mary Cocktail Sauce as part of a raw shellfish bar.


Sous vide:

1. Set your sous vide water bath to 130F (for ceviche) or 135F (for traditional seafood usage).
2. In a large bowl, toss shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Place shrimp in a heavy duty zipper-lock bag or a vacuum bag. If desired, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30ml) olive oil or butter and aromatics. Remove all air from bag using the water displacement method or a vacuum sealer. Press shrimp into a single layer.
3. Add bagged shrimp to preheated water bath and cook for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour (the texture should show very little variation within this time frame). Remove shrimp from bag to a paper towel-lined plates. Serve hot, or chill and serve cold.
