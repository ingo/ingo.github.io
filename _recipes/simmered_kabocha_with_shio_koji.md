This recipe is a simple yet flavorful side dish that showcases the unique taste of kabocha squash. The shio koji seasoning enhances the natural sweetness of the kabocha, making this a dish that is sure to impress.

### Ingredients

* `12 oz` kabocha squash/pumpkin
* `1 tbsp` Hikari Miso Shio Koji (or 2 tsp kosher salt for 1 tbsp Shio Koji)
* Water

### Directions

1. Cut the kabocha into 1-inch cubes and put into a medium saucepan.
2. Add just enough water to completely cover kabocha, and add Hikari Miso Shio Koji.
3. Bring to a boil then lower the heat to simmer. Cook the kabocha until a skewer goes through smoothly, about 4-5 minutes.
4. Cover with a lid and set aside to allow the flavor to slowly be absorbed. Let the kabocha squash cook slowly with the residual heat while it absorbs flavor from the shio koji. If you overcook the kabocha squash, it will get mushy and lose its shape and appeal. You can serve this dish cold, at room temperature, or warm.
