This slow-cooked lamb shoulder is a family favorite, perfect for a Sunday Night Roast. The lamb shoulder is stuffed with rosemary and garlic to infuse the meat with flavor and slow roasted to perfection. 

### Ingredients

* `3.5 lb / 1.8kg` lamb shoulder (bone in)
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `2 tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` black pepper
* `1` onion, quartered (no need to peel)
* `1` head garlic, cut in half horizontally
* `3` garlic cloves, cut into slivers
* `8` sprigs rosemary
* `1 cup / 250ml` water

#### Gravy

* `2 tbsp` flour
* `2 cups / 500 ml` beef broth (or 1 cup red wine + 1 cup water)
* Salt and pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 220C/425F (fan forced/convection) / 240C/465F (standard).
2. Rub the lamb with the olive oil, salt and pepper.
3. Make 12 incisions in the lamb, deep as you can but without piercing through the bottom of the lamb.
4. Stuff bits of rosemary and garlic slivers into the holes.
5. Place the onion, halved garlic bulb and rosemary in the base of a roasting pan. Place the lamb on top. Pour water around.
6. Cover with lid or tightly with a double layer of foil. Place in the oven, and TURN DOWN to 160C/320F (fan forced / convection) or 180C/350F (standard).
7. Roast, covered, for 3 hours. Remove foil, turn up the oven to 220C/425F and roast for a further 20 to 30 minutes, until the skin is browned and crisp.
8. Remove lamb from the roasting pan and transfer to a plate. Cover loosely with foil then a couple of tea towels and let it rest for at least 20 minutes, up to a couple of hours.
9. Serve with gravy.

#### Gravy

1. Tilt the pan and use a spoon to remove all but around 2 tbsp of fat.
2. Place the roasting pan on the stove over medium high heat. Add the flour and stir to mix in with the fat. Cook for 30 seconds.
3. Add the stock gradually and stir to combine. Use a potato masher to mash the onion and garlic, making sure that all the garlic squeezes out of the skin.
4. Allow it to simmer for 1 to 2 minutes until it is just before your desired consistency, then remove from the stove. Season to taste with salt and pepper, strain into bowl being sure to squeeze all juices out of garlic etc, then transfer into gravy jug.

### Notes

- This method of slow roasting is not suitable for lamb leg. It must be made using lamb shoulder which is a tougher and fattier cut of meat.
