This recipe is a great alternative when the store-bought version is sold out. This recipe was born out of necessity, though kids love it.

### Ingredients

* `2` 16 ounce bags frozen corn (yellow "or" shoepeg white, any brand)
* `2 tsp` salt
* `½ cup` butter, cut up
* `1 tsp` sugar
* `1 cup` water
* `1 ½ tsp` cornstarch

### Directions

1. Add corn to large sauce pan along with all ingredients except water and cornstarch.
2. Stir corn mixture over medium heat until butter is melted.
3. Combine water and cornstarch and stir until cornstarch is dissolved.
4. Slowly add water to corn in sauce pan, stirring constantly.
5. Reduce heat to simmer and stir until sauce thickens.
6. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until corn is tender, about 10 minutes.
