description: Though the name sounds like a wild sweet-tooth's parade, this fried chicken recipe actually makes perfect sense when paired with a spicy scallion cornmeal waffle. The chicken is first marinated in a mixed berry jam, which caramelizes into a sticky, sweet glaze when fried. Almost any summer fruit jam can be substituted in the marinade. Peanut oil or another high smoke point oil is best for frying, if available.

### Ingredients

#### For the marinated chicken:

* `1` large egg
* `⅓ cup` balsamic vinegar
* `⅓ cup` strawberry jam (or other summer-fruit jam)
* `2 pounds` large, thick chicken breast cutlets (about 6 pieces)

#### For the dredge:

* `1 cup` all-purpose flour
* `½ cup` cornstarch
* `2 tsp` kosher salt
* `1 tsp` ground ginger
* `1 tsp` dried thyme
* `1 tsp` onion powder
* `1 tsp` garlic powder
* `1 tsp` black pepper

#### For frying and serving:

* Peanut oil (or other oil with a high smoke point), as needed (about 3 cups)
* `1 tsp` kosher salt
* Scallion Cornmeal Waffles, or Bacon Cornbread

### Directions

1. Prepare the marinade: In a large bowl, whisk the egg, vinegar and jam. Add chicken cutlets, turn until coated, cover and chill for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
2. Prepare the dredge: In a large bowl, whisk the flour, cornstarch and spices until combined.
3. When you're ready to fry, add enough peanut oil to a large (10-inch) cast-iron skillet to form a layer that is 1 inch deep. Heat oil over medium-high to around 300 degrees.
4. Brush off any bits of fruit from the chicken. With one hand, coat each cutlet in the seasoned flour dredge. Set coated cutlets to the side of the bowl while you coat the remaining ones. Wash your hands.
5. Fry the chicken: Working in batches to avoid crowding, and adjusting the temperature as needed to hover around the 300-degree mark, place 2 to 3 pieces of chicken at a time in the fat. Using tongs, flip the chicken at the 3-minute mark, 7-minute mark and 8-minute mark, cooking until the chicken appears to float and is golden brown. (Each batch should fry for about 8 minutes total.)
6. Transfer fried cutlets to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and cook remaining cutlets.
7. Serve chicken on a scallion cornmeal waffle, if you like, or with bacon cornbread with Cheddar and scallions. Or, for a lighter morning or midday meal, serve with a breakfast salad.
