This Tamal Dough recipe is a traditional Mexican recipe passed down through generations. The recipe originates from my grandmother who used to sell lunches to local miners in Shafter, Texas. She would wake up as early as 4 a.m. to start the tedious process of making dough for corn tortillas and tamales. Today, we continue her legacy by using her recipe to make the perfect tamal dough.

### Ingredients

* `2 pounds` lard
* `2 teaspoons` baking powder
* `2 tablespoons` salt
* `5 pounds` fresh ground masa, unprepared for tamales
* `2 to 3 cups` broth from cooked pork roast or chicken broth
* `½ cup` red chile sauce (only add if making red chile pork tamales)
* corn husks

### Directions

1. Place 1 pound of lard in a large stand mixer and mix until fluffy, scraping sides so the lard stays in the center of the mixing bowl.
2. Add half the baking powder and half the salt to the lard and mix together.
3. Add half the masa and mix together. Slowly add half the broth and half the red chile sauce, if using, to the masa and mix until combined. The mixture should be about the consistency of smooth peanut butter. If not, add more broth as necessary. Test the masa by taking a small piece (1/2 teaspoon) and dropping it into a cup of warm water. If it floats it is ready; if it sinks, add a little more lard, beat for another minute and test it again. Repeat this process until the masa floats. Pour the masa mixture into a bigger bowl. Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.
4. Cover the masa and set aside while you prepare your filling of choice.

### Notes

- Place a penny at the bottom of the pot, when you hear the penny rattle that means the water level is low and it is time to add more water to the steamer.
