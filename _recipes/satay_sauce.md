### Ingredients

* `4` dried long red chillies
* `1 tbsp` coriander seeds
* `1 tbsp` cumin seeds
* pinch of salt
* `1 tbsp` chopped lemongrass
* `1/2 tbsp` chopped galangal
* `½ tsp` finely grated kaffir lime zest
* `1 tbsp` chopped red shallots
* `2 tbsp` chopped garlic
* `1/2 tbsp` cleaned and chopped coriander roots
* `1½ cups` coconut cream
* `2 tbsp` shaved palm sugar
* `1/2 cup` finely ground peanuts
* `1/2 cup` stock, water or coconut milk
* `1` pandanus leaf, knotted - optional
* `1 tbsp` fish sauce - more or less, to taste
* pinch of roasted chilli powder

### Directions

1. Nip off the stalks of the chillies then cut along their length and scrape out the seeds. Soak the chillies in water for about 15 minutes until soft. 
2. While the chillies are soaking, toast the coriander and cumin seeds separately in a dry, heavy-based frying pan until they are aromatic, shaking the pan often to prevent the spices from scorching. 
3. Grind to a powder using an electric grinder or a pestle and mortar then set aside. 
4. Drain the soaked chillies, squeezing to extract as much water as possible, then roughly chop them. 
5. Using a pestle and mortar, pound the chillies with a pinch of salt, then add the lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime zest, shallots, garlic and coriander roots one ingredient at a time, reducing each to a fine paste before adding the next. 
6. Alternatively, puree the ingredients in an electric blender. You will probably need to add a little water to aid the blending, but not try to add more than necessary. Halfway through, turn the machine off and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, then turn it back on and whiz the paste until it is completely pureed. 
7. Finally, stir in the ground spices.
8. Heat 1 cup of the coconut cream in a small pan and simmer for a minute or two before adding the paste and frying it gently for 4-5 minutes until fragrant and oily, stirring regularly. 
9. Season with the palm sugar then moisten with the remaining coconut cream. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, then stir in the peanuts and simmer for 5 minutes. 
10. Moisten with the stock or coconut milk, add the pandanus leaf, if using, and simmer for another 5 minutes. 
11. Season with the fish sauce, chilli powder and a pinch of salt. It should be quite oily, rich, dark, sweet, nutty and spicy. 
12. Remove from the heat and let the sauce sit for about an hour - it will improve happily. Serve warm or at room temperature.
