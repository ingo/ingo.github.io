This is a wonderful refreshing Indian salad that pairs really well with rich, spicy curries. Made with slices of juicy tomato, scattered with red onion, and drizzled with a mint dressing, then finished with a small pinch of garam masala. The dressing here is simply Raita, thinned down slightly with water so it’s pourable. Raita is a green mint yogurt sauce that is often served on the side of curries. Both yogurt and mint are ideal for cooling the palette in case you can’t handle the heat!

### Ingredients

* `3` large ripe tomatoes, sliced into rounds
* `1/4` red onion, very thinly sliced
* `1 pinch` of garam marsala, to taste (optional)
* `1 cup / 250g` plain yoghurt
* `2 cups` mint leaves
* `1 tbsp` lemon juice, or to taste
* `Couple of pinches` of salt
* `1 tbsp+` water

### Directions

1. Blitz ingredients in a food processor until it becomes a smooth, bright green sauce.
2. Use extra water to thin to a pourable consistency.
3. Put the tomatoes in a bowl. Sprinkle with pinch of salt, mix with your hands and leave to rest for 10 minutes (extracts a bit of juice, makes them juicier).
4. Drain the tomatoes. Mix with the onion in a serving bowl.
5. Drizzle dressing over the tomato salad.
6. Sprinkle with a pinch of garam marsala if desired.

### Notes

- Raita is typically a thin, pourable consistency, whether used for dressing or as sauce. Recipe makes more dressing than you need for this salad because it's hard to make less in a food processor so serve leftovers with the main. Nutrition assumes 1/2 cup of the Mint Dressing is used for the salad.
