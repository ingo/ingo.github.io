Kansas City BBQ sauce is something I recommend trying at least once. Though, once you make some from scratch, you’ll likely find yourself making your own sauce over and over again. I personally love making food that has all natural ingredients without anything added, and this BBQ sauce is full of only the good stuff.

### Ingredients

* `14 oz` can crushed tomatoes
* `1 cup` ketchup
* `¾ cup` brown sugar
* `½ cup` apple cider vinegar
* `½ cup` molasses
* `1 tbsp` smoked paprika
* `1 tbsp` salt
* `2 tsp` ground black pepper
* `1 tsp` chili powder
* `1 tsp` garlic powder
* `1 tsp` onion powder
* `½ tsp` red pepper flakes
* `½ tsp` ground mustard

### Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan. Whisk to combine. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low to simmer.
2. Simmer for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool completely before transferring to an air tight container.
3. This sauce can be used immediately, but I recommend refrigerating overnight for the best flavor. This sauce will last 2 weeks in the refrigerator if sealed tightly in an air tight container.

### Notes

- This sauce is great to make and eat the same day, but if you’ve got the time to let it sit, it is even better after letting it rest for 24 hours. That extra day in the refrigerator gives all of the ingredients time to hang out and get comfortable with each other, resulting in a smoother and more delicious sauce. If you end up with any leftovers, it lasts great in the refrigerator. Make sure you keep it in an airtight container, and it should last you at least two weeks.
