This recipe was inspired by the chocolate sorbet by Double Rainbow ice cream, a San Francisco company. It uses both chopped chocolate and cocoa powder, a combination that reminds me of the fantastic hot chocolate recipe from Pierre Herm√© in Jeffrey Steingarten's _[It Must've Been Something I Ate](http://www.amazon.com/Mustve-Been-Something-I-Ate/dp/0375727124/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230264290&sr=8-1)._ The result is an incredibly rich concoction--almost like eating frozen fudge.

### Ingredients

* `2 1/4 cups` water
* `1 cup` sugar
* `3/4 cup` unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
* A pinch of salt
* `6 ounces` bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (the bittersweet Pound Plus bar from Trader Joe's is fine)
* `1/2 tsp` vanilla extract, or 1/2 a vanilla bean. If using a vanilla beam split and scrape out the seeds with a knife.

### Directions

1. In a four-quart saucepan, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of the water with the sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.
2. Bring to a boil, whisking frequently.
3. Let it boil, whisking constantly, for 45 seconds. If it begins to boil over, remove quickly from heat until the foaming subsides.
4. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped chocolate.
5. Let sit a few minutes and then stir to combine.
6. Add the remaining water and vanilla extract (or vanilla bean) and pour into a blender.
7. Blend for 45 seconds and pour mixture into a bowl.
8. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold.
9. Freeze in an ice cream machine following the manufacturer's directions.
10. If it's too soft when finished freezing, it can help to put the sorbet in an air tight container and freeze for a few hours to firm the mixture.
