Grapefruit and lime bring acidity balanced by tequila's vegetal verve, Campari's bitterness, and a hint of salt for focus. This summer refresher from Zac Overman at Seattle's Sitka & Spruce is the perfect example of delayed gratification. Put in some advance work to make a rich, almost buttery sweet-tart grapefruit cordial and you have the makings of a whole pitcher's worth of drinks at a moment's notice.

### Ingredients

**For the Salted Grapefruit Cordial:**

* `1/2 cup` fresh juice from 2 large Ruby Red grapefruit, plus peel of 1 Ruby Red Grapefruit (with little to no white pith) (see note)
* `1 cup` sugar
* `1/4 cup` fresh juice from about 8 limes
* `1/4 cup` water
* `1 1/2 teaspoons` kosher salt

**For One Cocktail:**

* `2 ounces` blanco tequila, such as Chinaco
* `1 ounce` Salted Grapefruit Cordial
* `3/4 ounce` fresh juice from 2 limes
* `1/4 ounce` Campari
* Seltzer

### Directions

1. **For the Salted Grapefruit Cordial:** Bury grapefruit peel in sugar in a pint-sized container. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. The next day, add grapefruit juice, 1/4 cup lime juice, water, and salt to sugar and stir or shake until sugar is completely dissolved. Remove grapefruit peel and refrigerate cordial, which will last for several weeks.
3. **For the Cocktail:** In a cocktail shaker, combine tequila, 1 ounce of cordial, 3/4 ounce of lime juice, and Campari. Fill shaker with ice, and shake until well chilled, about 15 seconds. Strain into a highball glass filled with ice and top with soda to taste. Garnish with a grapefruit twist if desired.

### Notes

- Since you need the grapefruit peel on day 1 and the juice on day 2, you can peel 1 grapefruit on the first day, then store the peeled grapefruit in the refrigerator overnight until you are ready to juice it the next day.
