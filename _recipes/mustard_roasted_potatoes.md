These Mustard-Roasted Potatoes are a delightful twist on the classic roasted potatoes. The tangy mustard adds a unique flavor that will have everyone asking for seconds. The recipe was first featured in the 2006 edition of Barefoot Contessa at Home.

### Ingredients

* `2 pounds` small white or Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled
* `1 large` onion
* `3 tablespoons` good olive oil
* `2 tablespoons` whole-grain mustard
* `2 teaspoons` kosher salt
* `1 teaspoon` freshly ground black pepper
* `1/4 cup` chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
2. Cut the potatoes in halves or quarters, depending on their size, and place them on a sheet pan. Remove the ends of the onions, peel them, and cut them in half. Slice them crosswise in 1/4-inch-thick slices to make half-rounds. Toss the onions and potatoes together on the sheet pan. Add the olive oil, mustard, 2 teaspoons salt, and the pepper and toss them together. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the potatoes are lightly browned on the outside and tender on the inside. Toss the potatoes from time to time with a metal spatula so they brown evenly.
3. Serve hot sprinkled with chopped parsley and a little extra salt.

### Notes

* Turning the potatoes is essential to keep the onions from burning.
* A nice variation is to use harissa instead of mustard.
* The potatoes may actually be done in 45 minutes if they are in about 1 1/2 inch pieces.
* The dish actually is tastier the next day as leftovers.
* The leftover potatoes can be used in a breakfast taco the next day.
* If you can, make a double batch, they are that good.
