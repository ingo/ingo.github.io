Peking Duck is a labor of love, combining meticulous preparation and cooking techniques to create a dish with crispy skin, succulent meat, and layers of flavor. This recipe highlights traditional methods, from air-separating the skin to aging and roasting the duck.

### Ingredients

* `1` whole duck, about 4 pounds (head and feet intact, if possible)
* Air compressor or similar tool
* `1 cup` vinegar
* `1/2 cup` salt
* `2 sticks` licorice root
* `4 pods` black cardamom
* `6` star anise
* `1/4 cup` maltose syrup
* `2 tablespoons` dark soy sauce
* `2 tablespoons` duck spice mix (e.g., cinnamon, clove, fennel)

### Directions

1. Use an air compressor to separate the duck’s skin from the meat by inserting the nozzle into the cavity while holding the neck to prevent air escape.
2. Remove the feet and wings.
3. Carefully debone the thigh bones from inside the cavity to ensure even cooking.
4. Prepare a blanching liquid with vinegar, salt, licorice, black cardamom, and star anise. Bring to a boil.  
5. Blanch the duck briefly, avoiding water entering the cavity to maintain crispy skin.  
6. Baste the duck continuously during blanching to tighten the skin.
7. Pluck out any remaining feathers or hairs.  
8. Skewer the duck to create tension and ensure even drying.  
9. Apply a thin, even layer of maltose syrup mixed with dark soy sauce and duck spice.  
10. Hang the duck in a cool, ventilated space or refrigerator for 1-2 weeks to age.
11. Lightly smoke the duck using wood chips for 30 minutes. The smoke enhances the flavor and texture without overpowering the dish.
12. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).  
13. Roast for 17 minutes at 350°F, then increase heat to 450°F (230°C) and roast for an additional 6 minutes.  
14. Rest the duck for 20 minutes before carving.

### Notes

* Aging the duck for 1-2 weeks is crucial for achieving the signature crispy skin.  
* The preparation process requires precision and care, making it perfect for special occasions.  
* Experiment with different smoking woods to find your preferred flavor.
