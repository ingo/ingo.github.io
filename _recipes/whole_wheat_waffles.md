This recipe for whole-wheat waffles is a breakfast favorite. The use of whole-wheat flour adds a healthy twist to the traditional waffle recipe. The waffles are light and fluffy, with a hint of sweetness from the honey. The addition of cinnamon gives it a warm, comforting flavor. Top these waffles with warm 100% pure maple syrup and fresh fruit for a satisfying start to your day.

### Ingredients

* `2` large eggs
* `1 ¾ cups` milk (You can use everything from skim milk to thick buttermilk)
* `¼ cup` [oil](http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2011/05/14/mini-pledge-week-10-no-refined-oils/ "Mini-Pledge Week 10: No Refined Oils") (Melted butter can be used)
* `1 tbsp` honey
* `½ tsp` ground cinnamon
* `¼ tsp` baking soda
* `1 ½ cups` whole-wheat flour (King Arthur’s organic white whole-wheat flour can be used)
* `2 tsp` baking powder
* `⅛ tsp` salt
* Warmed 100% pure maple syrup for serving
* Fresh fruit for serving

### Directions

1. Preheat your waffle iron.
2. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, oil, honey, cinnamon, and baking soda until well combined.
3. Add in the flour, baking powder, and salt and whisk together just until the large lumps disappear.
4. When the waffle iron is hot, dab it with a little butter and then ladle some batter onto the center of the iron. Follow the instructions that came with your waffle maker to know how long it should be cooked (usually takes about 3 - 4 minutes each).
5. Keep waffles warm until you finish cooking all of them. Top with pure maple syrup and fruit. Enjoy!

### Notes

- Ensure to keep the waffles warm as you cook the rest. This will ensure they all stay crispy and delicious.
