This Texas Beef Chili, also known as Chili Con Carne, is a hearty dish with tender chunks of beef enveloped in a deep, spicy, and smoky sauce. It's like a chili-flavored beef stew that's perfect for those cold winter nights.

### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` chili powders
* `1 tbsp` cumin
* `1 tbsp` oregano
* `1 tbsp` coriander
* `1 tsp` cinnamon
* `1/4 cup` cornmeal
* `1/2 cup` water
* `1 lb` beef
* `1 tsp` salt
* `4 slices` bacon
* `2` onions
* `2 cloves` garlic
* `2` jalapeños
* `2 cups` beef broth
* `1 cup` water
* `1 cup` beer
* `1 can` crushed tomatoes
* `1 tbsp` molasses
* `1 tbsp` cocoa powder

### Directions

1. Mix the chili powders, cumin, oregano, coriander, cinnamon and cornmeal in a small bow and stir in 1/2 cup water to form a thick paste; set aside.
2. Season the beef with the salt; set aside.
3. In a large pot or Dutch oven, fry the bacon over medium heat, stirring frequently so it doesn't stick, until the fat renders and the bacon crisps, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour all but a few teaspoons of fat from the pot into a small bowl; set aside.
4. Increase the heat to medium-high. Sear the meat in three batches (it should be in a single layer), until well browned on one side, about 4 minutes per batch, adding more of the reserved bacon fat as necessary. Place the seared meat on a plate. Add about 1/4 cup of water to the pot (it will smoke), and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon to release all of the flavorful brown bits. Pour the dark liquid over the seared meat.
5. Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat to the pot. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeños and cook 2 minutes more. Add the reserved chili paste and sauté until fragrant, a few minutes. 
6. Add the beef broth and stir with a whisk until the spice mixture is completely dissolved. Scrape the bottom of the pot with the whisk to release any spices. Stir in the the water, beer, crushed tomatoes, molasses and cocoa powder. Add the reserved bacon and seared beef back to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and cover, leaving the lid just barely ajar. Simmer, stirring occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn, until the meat is meltingly tender and the juices are thickened, 2-1/2 - 3 hours. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

### Notes

* When selecting the meat, be sure not to buy anything generically labeled "Stew Meat." Also, you will lose about 1/2 pound after trimming the fat, so if you buy the meat already trimmed and cubed, you'll only need about 3-1/2 pounds.
* To make bacon easier to chop, try placing it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes first. The colder it is, the easier it is to cut.
* If you touch the seeds of the jalapeño pepper, just be sure to wash your hands well and avoid touching your eyes.
* The chili can be frozen for up to 3 months. Before serving, defrost it in the refrigerator for 12 hours and then reheat it on the stovetop over medium heat until hot.
