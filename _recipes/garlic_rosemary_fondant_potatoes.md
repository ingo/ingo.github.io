Fondant potatoes originated in France and is a method of cooking potatoes. Traditionally a large potato would be cut into a cylinder, then ends are browned and then they are slowly roasted in butter and broth. We used the Baby Boomer varietal from The Little Potato Company for this recipe, they are a yellow-white flesh Creamer potato that already is smooth and silky in the center and just melts all over the palette.

### Ingredients

* `1.5 lbs` The Little Potato Company's Baby Boomers varietal
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `1 tbsp` butter
* `1 tbsp` garlic, minced or 4 smashed garlic cloves
* `1 cup` beef stock, you can use chicken or vegetable also
* `1 tsp` fresh snipped rosemary
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425F. Put the olive oil and butter into a medium sized (10 1/2") cast iron pan or one that is oven proof. Heat on medium heat and then add the garlic either minced or whole cloves smashed. Cook until fragrant for about 1 min. Remove from heat.
2. Add the Little potatoes straight from the bag into the pan and roll in the garlic sauce. Pour in the beef stock.
3. Season to taste with Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and fresh snipped rosemary.
4. Place back on the heat and bring to a boil and then into the oven for approximately 25 min. until almost all the stock is absorbed and the potatoes are tender.
5. Place back on the stove over medium high heat and cook off the remainder of the beef stock and allow the bottoms of the potatoes to brown. Remove the garlic if using the crushed cloves. Season if necessary and serve immediately.

### Notes

This recipe could be easily doubled with using either a larger cast iron pan, mine is a 10 1/2" and it fits 1 1/2 lbs of potatoes perfectly or use a roasting pan. You want the potatoes just to have enough room to give them a roll initially in the garlic sauce. The presentation is pretty though with them neatly tucked together. The tops brown on their own in the oven and the bottoms you brown up on the stove on medium high heat at the end.
