This isn't just carrot purée, but it's mostly carrots. Adjust the amount of butter and cream to suit, or substitute with milk if you're feeling health-conscious.

### Ingredients

* `3/4 lb` carrots
* `1` fennel bulb
* `5` mint leaves
* `1 cup` chicken or vegetable stock
* `1 tbsp` butter
* `2 tbsp` heavy cream or milk
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* pepper

### Directions

1. Peel the carrots and chop roughly.
2. Cut the top off the fennel bulb, remove the very bottom off the base, slice in half, remove the tough inner core, and chop roughly.
3. Place the carrots, fennel, mint, stock and salt in a two-quart saucepan over medium heat.
4. Simmer until vegetables are very soft, 20-25 minutes.
5. Remove pot from heat.
6. Add butter and cream and purée with an immersion blender, food processor or blender.
7. Adjust salt and pepper to taste and serve.
8. This may be prepared a day ahead of time. Warm in the oven or microwave.
