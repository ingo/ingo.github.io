This cilantro oil is a staple in the Ceviche kitchen. If you're a fan of cilantro, it's worth making a large batch as it can be stored in the fridge for about a month.

### Ingredients

* `1 small bunch` of fresh cilantro (leaves and stalks)
* `scant 1/2 cup / 100 ml` vegetable oil

### Directions

1. Place the cilantro and vegetable oil in a saucepan and set over medium heat.
2. Heat gently for 5 minutes, without boiling, to let the cilantro wilt. Then remove from heat and allow to cool.
3. Transfer the cooled cilantro and oil to a food processor or blender and blitz until smooth.
4. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve and decant into a sterilized bottle. Store in a cool, dark place.

### Notes

- The cilantro oil can be stored in the fridge for up to a month.
