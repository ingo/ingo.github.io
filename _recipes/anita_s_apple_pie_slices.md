According to Jane, from Hampton Elementary, “This recipe is one that my mom used to make quite often. It was what my brother requested instead of birthday cake each year! It is every bit as good as apple pie.”

### Ingredients

* Crust:
  * `2 cups` flour
  * `3/4 cup` shortening
  * `1 tsp` salt
  * `1` egg yolk, lightly beaten
  * `1/2 cup` milk
* Filling:
  * `5 cups` sliced, peeled apples (6-7 good sized apples)
  * `1 cup` sugar (more sugar may be needed if your apples are tart). We used `3/4 cup` sugar and `1/4 cup` VANILLA SUGAR
  * `2 tbsp` flour
  * `1/2 tsp` PENZEYS CINNAMON
  * `1 tbsp` butter
  * `1` egg white, lightly beaten
* Icing:
  * `1 tbsp` butter, melted
  * `3/4 cup` powdered sugar
  * `1/4 tsp` PURE VANILLA EXTRACT
  * `2-3 tsp` milk

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°. 
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, shortening and salt. Mix with your hands until it resembles coarse crumbs. 
3. In a small bowl, combine the egg yolk and milk. Add to the dough and mix. 
4. Divide the dough in two. Wrap one of the pieces of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. 
5. Pat or roll the other piece of dough into an ungreased 9x13 baking dish. 
6. Peel and slice the apples, and place on top of the crust. 
7. In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour and CINNAMON. Sprinkle the mixture over the apples. Dot with butter. 
8. Gently roll out the remaining crust on a lightly floured surface, large enough to fit the pan. Place over the apples. Brush with the egg white. 
9. Bake at 375° for 45 minutes. 
10. Cool and frost if desired. To make the icing, combine the butter, powdered sugar and VANILLA and mix. Add enough milk to make the icing your desired consistency.
