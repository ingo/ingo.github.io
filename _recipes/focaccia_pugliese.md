Puglia has a very special focaccia with an open, moist, tender crumb that you won't soon forget. This Focaccia Pugliese recipe is a traditional Italian flatbread from the Puglia region. It's a simple yet delicious bread that's perfect for dipping in olive oil or serving alongside your favorite Italian dishes.

### Ingredients

* `1` medium russet potato, peeled, diced and boiled until tender
* `1-1/2 tsp` of instant yeast
* `3-1/2 cups` all purpose flour
* `1 cup` of warm water reserved from potato water
* `2 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil, plus more for topping bread
* `1-1/4 tsp` salt
* Sea Salt for topping
* Extra virgin olive oil for topping

### Directions

1. Remove boiled potato from the water and put it through a food mill, ricer or grate through the large holes of a box grater. Set aside. Reserve the potato water.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer or processor, mix or pulse yeast, 1/2 cup of flour, and 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup of warm water until combined. Cover and set aside until bubbly, about 20 minutes. Add remaining dough ingredients including reserved potato.
3. If using a mixer, use the dough-hook and knead on medium speed for 5 minutes. For food processor, process until dough is smooth and elastic, about 40 seconds.
4. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat with oil, cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in volume.
5. With wet hands remove the dough to a half sheet pan (15½ x 10½ inch).
6. Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle third position and preheat oven to 425℉. Dimple the risen dough deeply enough to hold any topping that you choose.
7. Drizzle dough with olive oil and evenly sprinkle coarse salt and toppings (if desired).
8. Bake until focaccia bottom is golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly and serve warm.
