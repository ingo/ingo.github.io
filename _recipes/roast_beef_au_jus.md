This method is fairly foolproof, and yields a good roast with a large pink center.

### Ingredients

* `1` 4-5 beef roast, top sirloin preferred
* `1 tsp` olive oil
* `1` clove garlic
* `1 tsp` salt
* `½ tsp` pepper
* `½` onion
* `1` stalk celery
* `1` carrot
* `1 tbsp` Worcestershire Sauce
* `1 quart` beef stock
* `¼ cup` dry red wine

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 F.
2. Tie the roast with kitchen twine at 1-2" intervals to create an evenly-shaped package. Mash the garlic into a paste and coat the roast. Season all over with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan and brown the roast on all sides. Place the roast in a roasting pan on a wire rack in the oven, and roast until the beef reaches an internal temperature of 100 F. Meanwhile, chop the onion, celery and carrots into a medium dice. Once the roast reaches 100 degrees, add the onion, celery and carrot mixture to the pan along with 1 cup of water. Return the pan to the oven, and continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches 125 F. If the water evaporates, add another cup.
4. Remove the roast from the oven and place it aside to rest. Place the roasting pan on the stove, turn the heat to medium-high, and add the stock and wine, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Let simmer until reduced about 1/3, and then remove from heat, Pour through a fine sieve and season to taste with salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce.
5. To make a French Dip sandwich, carve the roast into thin slices. Lightly toast two pieces of bread (either rolls or slices), covering one with Swiss cheese to melt. Spread one piece with mayonnaise, the other with prepared horseradish. Add slices of beef, and place halves of sandwich together. Serve with a small bowl of jus for dipping.
