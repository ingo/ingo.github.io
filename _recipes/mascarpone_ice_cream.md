The high fat content of the cheese makes for an especially decadent frozen dessert. This Mascarpone Ice Cream recipe is a delightful treat that's sure to cool you down on a hot summer day. The creamy texture of the mascarpone cheese combined with the sweetness of the sugar and vanilla makes for a truly indulgent dessert.

### Ingredients

* `2 cups` whole milk
* `1 tablespoon` plus one teaspoon cornstarch
* `1/2 cup` mascarpone cheese
* `1 and 1/2 ounces` cream cheese (3 tablespoons), room temperature
* `1/2 teaspoon` vanilla bean paste (or vanilla extract)
* `1/4 teaspoon` fine sea salt
* `1 and 1/4 cups` heavy cream
* `2/3 cups` granulated sugar
* `1/4 cup` light corn syrup

### Directions

1. In a very small bowl, stir together `2 tablespoons` of the milk with all of the cornstarch until smooth (this is the "slurry").
2. In a large bowl, with a fork, mix together the mascarpone, cream cheese, vanilla, and salt until smooth and well combined. Set aside.
3. Fill a large bowl about 3/4 of the way full with cold water and ice. Have a large, clean Ziploc bag ready and propped open near the bowl.
4. In a large saucepan, combine the rest of the milk, the heavy cream, the sugar, and the corn syrup. Over medium-high heat, bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Boil for 4 minutes.
5. Take the pan off the burner and slowly whisk in the cornstarch slurry, whisking constantly. Return the pan to the burner and bring back to a boil, again over medium-high heat, now stirring continually with a rubber spatula. Cook until slightly thickened; this will take about 1 minute. Take the pan off the heat.
6. Pour the hot milk mixture slowly into the bowl with the mascarpone and cream cheese, whisking until it's quite smooth. Pour all of this into the Ziploc bag, seal it, and place it into the bowl of ice water. Leave the bag in there until the liquid in it feels pretty cold, at least half an hour. Add more ice to the bowl as needed.

### Notes

- Make sure to let the ice cream mixture cool completely before churning it in your ice cream maker. Enjoy your homemade Mascarpone Ice Cream!
