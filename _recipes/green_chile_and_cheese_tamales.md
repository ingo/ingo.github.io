description: These tamales truly benefit from the addition of fresh corn kernels to
  the masa mix. Although originally the recipe calls for the cheese to be mixed in,
  we prefer the cheese to be used as a filling. Modified from the Coyote Cafe cookbook
  by Mark Miller.

size: Depends on the size of the tamales. We generally make two recipes, and then
  freeze half of the tamales. They keep frozen very well.

### Ingredients

* `1/2 cup` milk
* `1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons` fresh corn kernels (frozen supersweet work very well)
* `1 cup` masa harina
* `3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons` butter, softened
* `1 tsp` baking powder
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* corn husks, soaked in hot water
* `1/2 cup` shredded jack cheese
* `1/2 cup` finely diced roasted green chiles

### Directions

1. Simmer the milk and corn together over medium heat for approximately 5 minutes. Strain the corn, reserve 1 cup, and then puree the rest with the milk. Add the puree to the masa harina and mix with a spoon.
2. With a mixer, whip the butter, baking powder and salt together until light and fluffy. In approximately 1/4 cup increments, whisk the masa into the butter. This should take 10-15 minutes.
3. Divide the masa evenly between the corn husks. Depending on the size, you should be able to get at least 8 tamales. Spread the masa into a small pad in the middle of the corn husk. Top with a little cheese and chile. Fold the tapered end up over the masa, roll, and then tie the top with a piece of corn husk.
4. Steam for 30 minutes over boiling water. A Chinese steamer over a wok works well for this purpose.

### Notes

- Use Carnitas inside. Omit the chile. Cheese is optional.
