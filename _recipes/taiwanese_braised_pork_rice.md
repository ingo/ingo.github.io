### Ingredients

* `12-15` medium sized shallots, sliced
* `1` slab of pork belly (the ideal pork belly should have five layers of fat/meat)
* `3` slices of ginger
* `2` pc star anise
* Five spice powder to taste
* White pepper to taste
* `3` cloves minced garlic
* Huatiao wine to taste
* Spring onions, cut into pieces

### Directions

1. Slice shallots thinly and deep fry until golden brown. Remove from pan. Keep some shallot oil in the pan to fry pork. The rest can be used for other stir-fry dishes.
2. Hand cut pork belly into 1cmx1cm slices.
3. Stir fry until the fat is rendered, with sliced ginger, minced garlic, white part of spring onions, dark soya, and huatiao wine (Chinese cooking wine).
4. Pour enough water to cover the meat, bring to a boil and add 2 star anise, five spice powder, white pepper, and the fried shallots.
5. Simmer 2-3hours, stirring every 15mins to make sure it doesn't burn.
6. After 3 hours, it should have a sticky, sweet braise. Serve over plain rice and garnish with spring onion.

Optional: add braised egg and salted vegetables (stir-fry with sugar if it's too salty).
