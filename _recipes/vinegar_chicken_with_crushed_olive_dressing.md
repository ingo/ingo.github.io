title: Vinegar Chicken With Crushed Olive Dressing
---
This recipe is a favorite of Alison Roman, who shared it with the New York Times. It's a perfect dish for those who love the combination of tangy vinegar, savory chicken, and the unique flavor of crushed olives.

### Ingredients

* `3 ½ pounds` bone-in, skin-on chicken parts
* `1 tsp` ground turmeric
* `6 tbsp` olive oil
* Kosher salt and ground pepper
* `½ cup` white wine vinegar
* `1 ½ cups` green Castelvetrano olives, crushed and pitted
* `2` garlic cloves, finely grated
* `1 cup` parsley, tender leaves and stems, chopped

### Directions

1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with turmeric and 2 tablespoons olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Make sure chicken is skin-side up, then pour vinegar over and around chicken and place in the oven.
2. Bake chicken, without flipping, until cooked through and deeply browned all over, 25 to 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, combine olives, garlic, parsley, the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper.
4. Once chicken is cooked, remove baking sheet from the oven and transfer chicken to a large serving platter, leaving behind any of the juices and bits stuck to the pan.
5. Make sure the baking sheet is on a sturdy surface (the stovetop, a counter), then pour the olive mixture onto the sheet. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, gently scrape up all the bits the chicken left behind, letting the olive mixture mingle with the rendered fat and get increasingly saucy. Pour olive mixture over the chicken, then serve.

### Notes

This dish is versatile and can be adjusted to taste. Some cooks have suggested adding lemon juice or zest, capers, or different types of olives. Others have suggested using a cast iron pan instead of a baking sheet for a different cooking experience. As always, adjust the recipe to your personal preference and enjoy!
