This recipe is a twist on the classic Italian dish, Cacio e Pepe. Instead of using traditional ingredients, this recipe introduces a new flavor profile while maintaining the creamy, cheesy goodness of the original dish. 

### Ingredients

* `1 pound` dry spaghetti
* `Cold water` to cover
* `2 tablespoons` kosher salt
* `100 grams` plus `10 grams` Pecorino-Romano cheese, finely grated (use the side of a box grater with the smallest holes)
* `50 grams` Parmesan finely grated, as above
* `1/3 cup` extra-virgin olive oil (or `2 tbsp` butter)
* `3/4 to 1 cup` starchy pasta water

Special hardware:

* Straight sided saute pan
* Spring-loaded tongs
* Large mixing bowl

### Directions

1. Combine pasta, water and salt in a 3-quart, high-sided saute pan. (Water should just barely cover pasta and measure 1 1/2 inches deep total.) Cover and set over medium-high heat.
2. When water reaches a boil, remove the lid and decrease heat to medium to maintain a simmer. Stir the pasta every minute or so, making sure the ends of the noodles stay submerged and that they aren't sticking together.
3. While the pasta cooks, begin the sauce. Combine 100 grams of the Pecorino, all of the Parmesan and the olive oil in a large, deep mixing bowl. Work ingredients together with the back of a wooden spoon until a thick paste forms.
4. When the pasta has been simmering for 5 minutes, ladle 1 cup of the cooking water into a measuring cup then slowly drizzle 3/4 cup into cheese paste, mixing until smooth.
5. After the pasta has been cooking for 10 minutes start checking for doneness; you want it to be just barely al dente as there'll be some carryover cooking in the next step.
6. Use tongs to lift the pasta out of the cooking water and allow to briefly drain before adding to the cheese paste. Grasp the pasta with the tongs and stir vigorously for 2 minutes. The pasta will continue to release starch and the sauce will emulsify. Around a minute thirty you will see cheesy water magically transform into a proper sauce. If you find your sauce clumping, add a bit more of the pasta water and continue working the pasta.
7. Portion pasta into 4 bowls, top with reserved Pecorino and serve immediately.

### Notes

Few things in the culinary realm are worse than overcooked pasta, so if it's not ready the first time you taste it, keep checking every 30 seconds thereafter.
