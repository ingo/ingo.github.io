Cloud Potatoes are a heavenly side dish that will have your guests floating on cloud nine. This recipe was passed down from a mysterious source, and has been a crowd favorite ever since. The secret to their cloud-like texture is a combination of cream cheese and mayo, whipped to perfection.

### Ingredients

* `Yellow potatoes` (leave the peels on and cube them)
* `Mayo`
* `2 cups` chicken stock
* `1 block` cream cheese
* `Butter` (unsalted)
* `Salt` (to taste)
* `White pepper`
* Optional: `Bacon bits` or `chives`

### Directions

1. Cube the potatoes (wash them first!). Add them to a pot.
2. In the pot, add about 2 cups chicken broth and about a teaspoon of salt. Boil until cooked (about 10-15 min).
3. Once boiled, drain (save about 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid).
4. Put the potatoes back in the pot (not on the stove) and add some salt, and white pepper to taste. Mash them with a potato masher until broken up.
5. Get your hand mixer out (you really do need one for this recipe). To the potatoes, add some chicken stock (maybe 1/2 of cup) and whip them for about 30 seconds. 
6. Then add the cream cheese (1 block) and mayo (maybe 3/4 cup). Whip again until smooth. 
7. Optional: Add bacon bits, or chives for something extra.

### Notes

- Remember to save some of the cooking liquid from the potatoes. It adds a depth of flavor to the final dish. Also, don't skimp on the whipping process. This is what gives the potatoes their cloud-like texture. Enjoy!
