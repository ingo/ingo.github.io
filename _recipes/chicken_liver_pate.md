This chicken pâté recipe is a favorite of Sam Sifton, a food editor at The New York Times. It's a versatile dish that can be served in various ways, and it's quick and easy to prepare.

### Ingredients

* `8 tbsp` unsalted butter, cut into cubes
* `2` medium shallots, peeled and finely chopped
* `1 pint` fresh chicken livers, approximately 1 pound, trimmed
* `1 tbsp` fresh thyme leaves, chopped
* `⅓ cup` Madeira or port
* `3 tbsp` heavy cream, plus more as needed
* Kosher salt to taste

### Directions

1. Put a large, heavy sauté pan over medium heat, and melt 4 tablespoons of the butter until it begins to foam. Add the shallots, and sauté them until translucent, being careful not to allow them to brown. Add the livers, thyme and Madeira or port, and bring the heat to high. Cook, occasionally stirring the livers around in the pan with a spoon, until the wine has reduced and the livers are lightly browned but still very soft and pink on the inside, approximately 5 minutes.
2. Remove the pan from the stove, and put its contents into a blender or food processor, along with the cream and the remaining butter. Purée until smooth, adding a little more cream if necessary. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding salt if necessary.
3. Pack the pâté into a glass jar or bowl, then smooth the top with a spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about two hours or up to five days. Serve with bacon-onion jam and copious amounts of toast.

### Notes

This recipe can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days. It pairs well with bacon-onion jam and toast.
