The sauce is not complicated, and the whole dish comes together relatively quickly.

### Ingredients

* `2 tsp` olive oil
* `4` 4-to 5-ounce loin lamb chops
* `1/3 cup` chopped shallots
* `3/4 cup` ruby Port
* `1/2 cup` low-salt chicken broth
* `1/2 cup` dried tart cherries (we used Montmorency cherries from Costco)
* `3 tbsp` cherry or raspberry jam
* `1 tbsp` balsamic vinegar
* `1/2 tsp` ground cardamom
* chopped fresh mint or parsley
* salt
* pepper

### Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepans over medium heat. Season the lamb chops on all sides with salt and pepper. Cook the chops, turning often, until they reach the desired doneness, approximately 10 minutes. Remove the chops and keep warm under foil.
2. Pour off any extra oil from the pan and add the shallots, saut√©ing 1 minute. Add port, chicken broth, cherries, jam, vinegar and cardamom to shallots and simmer until thickened to a thin syrup. Season with salt and pepper. Plate lamb and pour sauce over the top, sprinkling with parsley or mint, if desired.
