### Ingredients

* `1 kg` beef
* `500g` peeled, quartered potatoes
* `400g` red onions
* `30-40g` sweet paprika
* `To taste` salt
* `To taste` kummel (caraway seeds)
* `2` crushed garlic cloves
* `To taste` green and red peppers (cut into strips)
* `To taste` tomatoes (cut into strips)
* `To taste` csipetke

### Directions

1. Place the onions in the bottom of a large pan, then the chopped meat with salt, caraway, garlic, paprika, the peppers and the tomatoes. 
2. Add water to cover. 
3. Cook in oven until meat is tender, then add potatoes, turn down heat, and cook slowly until potatoes are cooked fully, and the fat rises to the surface. It should be slightly soupy at the end.

### Notes

This isn't quite the way Ingo's dad used to make it. It's missing "something".
