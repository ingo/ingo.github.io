This Turmeric Rice recipe was inspired by the delicious food from a local Mediterranean restaurant. After having a baby and spending a week in the hospital, the author's brother brought them some "real food" from this restaurant. The turmeric rice was so good that they decided to recreate it at home.
### Ingredients

* `1 tbsp` butter
* `1 tbsp` olive oil
* `¼ cup` onion, finely diced
* `4 cloves` garlic, minced
* `1 cup` jasmine rice, rinsed
* `1½ cups` low sodium chicken broth
* `1` dried bay leaf
* Salt to taste
* Pepper to taste
* `1½ tsp` turmeric

### Directions

1. Rinse rice until water runs clear, drain.
2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add olive oil and butter.
3. When butter is melted, add onion and garlic, saute until softened.
4. Add rice and turmeric. Stir until combined. Add chicken broth and bay leaf, cover pan. Increase heat and bring to a boil.
5. Reduce heat, allow to simmer 15-20 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Remove bay leaf, fluff with a fork and serve.

### Notes

- Turmeric is a rhizome (a tuber, similar to a root) like ginger – in fact, turmeric and ginger are in the same family! The powder made from the root is bright yellow, and sometimes used to dye foods. It will stain, so be careful when working with it! Turmeric is not spicy, and is often used in curry.
