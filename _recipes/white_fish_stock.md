This white fish stock recipe is a basic and versatile recipe that can be used in a variety of dishes. The stock is made from mixed bones and heads of white-fleshed fish, onion, parsley stems, lemon juice, and salt. It's a simple and flavorful base for many seafood dishes.

### Ingredients

* `1 tbsp` unsalted butter, softened
* `1 lb` mixed bones and heads of white-fleshed fish (such as Pacific cod, porgy, striped bass, turbot, or any combination of these), gills removed and bones and heads rinsed well
* `1` small onion, sliced
* `12` fresh parsley stems (reserve leaves for another use)
* `2 tbsp` fresh lemon juice
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `1/2 cup` dry white wine
* `3 1/2 cups` cold water

### Directions

1. Spread butter over bottom of a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan, then add fish bones and heads, onion, parsley stems, lemon juice, and salt. Steam mixture, covered, over moderately high heat, 5 minutes.
2. Add wine and water and bring to a boil. Skim froth, then reduce heat to moderate and simmer, uncovered, 25 minutes.
3. Pour stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing hard on solids and then discarding them.

### Notes

Stock can be made ahead and cooled completely, uncovered, then chilled, covered, 2 days or frozen 1 month.
