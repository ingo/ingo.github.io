Green Bean Shiraae is a traditional Japanese dish that combines lightly-cooked vegetables with crumbled tofu, miso, and sesame seeds. Commonly, spinach and green beans are used for this dish. It's a delightful way to enjoy your vegetables!

### Ingredients

* `2 cups` green beans (cut off the end)
* `¼` firm tofu

### Directions

1. Gather all the ingredients.
2. Cut and take ¼ of tofu out from the package and place it on a plate for at least 15 minutes so that it will dehydrate. Then crumble the tofu into smaller pieces with your hands. For the rest of tofu, keep in a airtight container and pour water until it covers the tofu. Keep in the fridge and use it within a few days.
3. Boil green beans until tender (please don’t overcook) and drain well. Cut into half.
4. Grind sesame seeds and add miso, sugar and soy sauce.
5. Combine green beans, crumbled tofu and sesame mixture all together. Serve cold or room temperature.
