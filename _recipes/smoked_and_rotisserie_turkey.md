This recipe offers two methods of preparing your turkey - smoked and rotisserie. Both methods result in a flavorful and moist turkey, but the rotisserie method was considered slightly saltier and more flavorful. 

### Ingredients

* `13.78 lbs` turkey
* `2.78 tbsp` salt (Morton’s kosher) or ~5 lbs per tablespoon

**Apple Dry Brine**
* `1 tbsp` garlic powder
* `1 package` freeze dried apples (4 oz from Trader Joe’s? blitzed to powder)
* `1 tbsp` Herbes de Provence

**Mushroom Brine**
* Salt - equivalent sodium from mushroom powder (so was about 2.5 tbsp)
* `1 tbsp` Umami powder

**Basting Mixture**
* Turkey stock
* Apple cider
* Garlic
* Butter
* Herbes de Provence

### Directions

1. Prepare the apple dry brine by mixing salt, garlic powder, powdered freeze dried apples, and Herbes de Provence.
2. Prepare the mushroom brine by mixing salt and umami powder.
3. Apply the brines on the turkeys and wrap in plastic for 2 days.
4. The night before cooking, remove the turkeys from the plastic and air dry in the fridge.
5. For the smoked turkey, start smoking at 10 AM at 225 degrees for 3 hours. Then, lower the temperature to 180 degrees at 1 PM. The turkey should be done around 4 PM. Place it in a 500 degree oven to finish cooking until the legs reach 160 degrees and the breast reaches 155 degrees.
6. For the rotisserie turkey, start at 2 PM. The fire should be 325 degrees, then 450, then 300, then 450. A more consistent temperature of 450 degrees at the beginning and then 325 for the rest is recommended.
7. Baste both birds with a mixture of turkey stock, apple cider, garlic, butter, and Herbes de Provence. Drizzle turkey stock over the cut meat.

### Notes

The rotisserie turkey was considered more flavorful and moist. It was also slightly saltier. This could be due to either a miscalculation in the saltiness of the mushroom powder, or the rotisserie method doing a better job at distributing the seasoning.
