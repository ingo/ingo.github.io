description: This recipe for fork-tender braised short ribs adapts easily for a small
  dinner or large gathering. Beef short ribs become fall-apart tender after a slow
  braise in red wine and stock. The savory braising liquid makes an incredible sauce.
  Short ribs are ideal for braising since the fat and connective tissue break down
  into tenderness after hours of low, moist heat. The wine and aromatics impart deep
  flavor. Cook a day ahead; they reheat beautifully.

### Ingredients

* `4` bone-in beef short ribs (approx. 2.5-3 pounds, you can also use boneless if you wish)
* `2 tsp` kosher salt (plus more to taste)
* `1 tsp` freshly ground black pepper (plus more to taste)
* `4` large carrots, roughly chopped
* `4` celery stalks, roughly chopped
* `1` medium onion, roughly chopped
* `6-8` garlic cloves, just “smashed” with the back of your knife
* `1-2 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `¾ cup` red wine
* `¾ cup` beef stock
* `½ tsp` dried thyme
* `½ tsp` dried oregano

### Directions

#### Method 1 - Cooktop & Oven:

1. Preheat Wolf Electric oven to Convection Roast 300°.
2. In a large bowl, season short ribs with salt and pepper, rubbing them with your hands to ensure evenly coated.
3. Heat a large, heavy bottomed pot (such as a Dutch oven) over medium high heat. Once hot, add oil and heat.
4. Add the ribs; you will know if the oil is hot if you instantly hear a sizzle! Brown ribs on all sides, 1-2 minutes per side. Once browned, remove and set aside (back in the bowl is fine).
5. Reduce heat to medium-low and add vegetables. Sautee 2 minutes until slightly cooked and starting to be come translucent. Add wine, stock, and dried herbs. Remove from heat and replace beef. Place the lid on and place into preheated oven.
6. Cook 2-3 hours until fork tender! This is great served over simple mashed potatoes, rice or even creamy polenta!

#### Method 2 - Cooktop Only:

1. Follow steps 1-5 from Method 1.
2. Turn down the heat to low and replace beef. Cook for 2-3 hours until Fork Tender.

#### Method 3 - Steam Oven:

1. Follow steps 1-5 from Method 1.
2. In the Wolf Convection Steam Oven, Select Wolf Gourmet and scroll down to A7 for "braising meats" and press OK. Follow the on-screen directions and prompts.
3. After the meat is done braising, simply combine the ingredients in the dutch oven.
