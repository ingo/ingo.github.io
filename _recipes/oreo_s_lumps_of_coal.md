title: Oreo's Lumps Of Coal
---

These lumps of coal are made from Oreo cookies and marshmallows, creating a sweet and crunchy treat. This recipe for Oreo's Lumps Of Coal comes from Rachel Burbank, a home cook who loves to share her delicious creations. While the recipe itself is not provided, many home cooks have shared their own versions and tips in the comments. Some suggest using marshmallow creme instead of marshmallows, while others recommend adding a bit of milk to the mixture. Regardless of the variations, one thing is clear - these Oreo's Lumps Of Coal are a hit!

### Ingredients

* `1 package` Oreo cookies
* `5 cups` large marshmallows
* `1/2 stick` butter

### Directions

1. Crush the Oreo cookies into fine crumbs.
2. Melt the butter in a pot over medium heat.
3. Add the marshmallows to the melted butter, stirring until they are completely melted and combined with the butter.
4. Quickly mix in the crushed Oreo cookies until they are evenly distributed throughout the marshmallow mixture.
5. Press the mixture into a greased 8x8 pan and let it cool before cutting into squares.

### Notes

* The consistency of the final product can vary depending on the altitude and how long the marshmallows are cooked. If they are cooked too long, the mixture can become hard.
* The cream filling does not need to be removed from the Oreos before crushing them.
* These treats can be made with different flavors of Oreos for a fun twist.
* If the mixture is too stiff to work with, adding a little bit of milk can help.
* These are similar to rice krispie treats, but with Oreos instead of cereal.
* If the mixture is too gooey after cooling, try refrigerating it overnight.
