This fluffy dough is made from fresh-ground masa. The recipe is a traditional Mexican dish, often enjoyed during celebrations and gatherings. The dough is filled with sweet corn kernels and seasoned to perfection, creating a delightful balance of flavors.

### Ingredients

* `1/2 cup` of chilled vegetable shortening, plus `1/2 cup` butter (firm)
* `1 1/2 teaspoons` baking powder
* `3 cups` (1 1/2 pounds) fresh ground masa
* About `1 cup` cool chicken broth, plus up to `1/2 cup` more for second beating
* `1 cup` cooked sweet corn kernels
* Salt, about `2 teaspoons`

### Directions

1. With an electric mixer, beat the shortening/butter combination with the baking powder until light, about 1 minute. Continue beating as you add the masa in three additions.
2. Slowly pour in a generous 2/3 cup of the broth, beating for another minute. Place a 1/2 teaspoon dollop of dough in a cup of cold water. If it floats dough will be tender and light. If it doesn't, beat a little longer.
3. Beat in enough additional broth to give the mixture the consistency of soft cake batter. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Add corn and cilantro (see previous recipe). 
4. Refrigerate for an hour or so, then rebeat, adding just enough additional liquid to bring the mixture to the consistency it had before. It should hold its shape softly on a spoon but not be runny. 

### Notes

This recipe makes about 20 medium tamales.
