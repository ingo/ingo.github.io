These buns are not only easy and quick to make but also taste deliciously soft, just like eating cotton candy. They can be served as a snack, eaten plain or with jams. The recipe was adapted from Sara's Hamburger Buns recipe.

### Ingredients

* `4 cups` all purposed flour
* `2 tsp` SAF instant yeast
* `5 tbsp` sugar
* `1 tbsp` kosher salt
* `1 1/2 cups` milk
* `1` large egg
* `8 tbsp` unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
* Sesame seeds for topping, optional
* `1-2 tbsp` additional milk for brushing 

### Directions

1. In a bowl, combine milk and egg together. Set aside.
2. In a mixer bowl fitted with dough hook attachment, add flour, SAF yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix with wooden spoon just to incorporate the ingredients. Make a well in the center. Pour milk-egg mixture into the well. Knead on low speed for about a minute.
3. Increase the speed to medium, knead for 3 minutes, add butter in 4 addition, kneading well in each addition before you adding the next. Continue to knead until you have a soft, and elastic dough, about 3 more minutes. Turn off the machine. Form the dough into ball, transfer to a lightly oiled container. Cover, and let rest until double in volume, about an hour.
4. Lay a pieces of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Preheat oven to 400 F.
5. Turn the dough onto a kitchen counter top. Divide into 12 equal pieces, working with one piece of dough at a time, form into a round bun. Place the round in a baking sheet. Repeat. Cover the baking sheet with clean kitchen towel. Let it rest at room temperature (draft free) for 30 minutes.
6. Brush, each round with milk, sprinkle with sesame seeds. bake in the middle oven for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, transfer to a wire rack to cool.

### Notes

* Sara's recipe uses 4 1/2 tsp active dry yeast. I used 2 tsp SAF-instant yeast, the only yeast I have in hand. I also like using this yeast, since it doesn't require to dissolve it first with liquid. In other words, you can mix it directly into dry ingredients.
* Instead of brushing the buns, I actually spray the buns using a clean spray bottle filled with about 2 tbs of milk.
* If you want to shape your buns into squares like what Sara did on hers, please visit her blog for the instruction.
