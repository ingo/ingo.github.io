This recipe is a tribute to one of our mentors, the inimitable Father Votar of Elf Cafe. His mushroom ceviche was so good that we've been trying to recreate it ever since. After countless attempts, we've finally found a version that does justice to the original. It combines lime-cured and lightly roasted mushrooms for a dish that's full of texture and flavor.

### Ingredients

* `4-6` king oyster mushrooms
* `8 ounces` oyster mushrooms
* `8 ounces` white beech mushrooms
* `8 ounces` brown beech mushrooms
* `8 ounces` crimini mushrooms
* `1 bunch` radishes
* `1 bunch` cilantro
* `2` jalapeños
* `2` red Fresno Chiles
* Canola spray

#### Leche Del Tigre Marinade
* `1½ cups` lime juice (about 10 limes)
* `1 cup` olive oil
* `3 teaspoons` sea salt
* `2` red onions, diced

### Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
2. Juice all the limes and combine in a mixing bowl with olive oil and salt. Whisk it well. Then add the diced onions and let sit.
3. Place your chiles on top of your stove top burner and turn the flame to high. Let them sit on the fire for 3 to 5 minutes and then turn them with tongs to expose each of their sides to the flame. You're aiming for solid black all over; don't be afraid to burn. When blackened, place the chiles in a paper bag, crimp it, and let them sit.
4. Tear the oyster mushrooms. For the kings, trim their woody ends and then slice in half down the middle lengthwise, then turn and slice both pieces into a handful of thick half-moons. Place oysters on one side of a sheet pan and king oysters on the other, spray with canola oil, and lightly toss to coat. Bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the kings get some color and the oysters get crispy around the gills.
5. Trim the ends off the brown and white beech mushrooms and slice in half. Trim the ends of the criminis and slice as thinly as your knife skills safely allow. Do the same with the radishes. Pick the leaves off the entire bunch of cilantro and combine with all of the above in a large mixing bowl.
6. Remove the chiles from their paper bag. Rub the charred skin off with your fingertips and discard. Depending on your heat tolerance, seed 1, 2, or all the chiles by gently slicing the outside "walls" of the pepper, and cleaning out the connective membranes and seeds. Add to the mushroom bowl.
7. Dress with the citrus marinade, toss, and check for seasoning adjustment. Then wrap it up and let rest in your fridge for at least 2 hours. Serve with chips, or fresh corn tortillas.

### Notes

- Fresh lime juice is a must for this recipe. Don't even think about using bottled lime juice.
- The extra char residue on the chiles, while probably carcinogenic, adds a good flavor. Do not wash it off.
- If you're looking for a real ripping pink, mincing the radishes works even better.
