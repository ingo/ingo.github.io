### Ingredients

* `2` eggs
* `1 cup` ricotta
* `1 cup` mozzarella (grated)
* `1/4 cup` parmesan cheese (finely grated)
* `2 tablespoons` fresh thyme
* `1/2 teaspoon` plus `1 tablespoon` salt (divided)
* `2 to 4 tablespoons` all-purpose flour (for dusting)
* `1` recipe for homemade pasta dough

### Directions

1. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk or a fork.
2. Add the ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon salt, mix well with a fork. Set aside.
3. Fill a stock pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.
4. Meanwhile, lightly dust a work surface or a pastry mat with flour.
5. Fill a small bowl or custard cup with room-temperature water.
6. Use a bench cutter or a knife to cut the dough into four to six equally sized portions and cover them loosely with plastic wrap.
7. Take one piece out and roll it into a thin sheet, about 5 to 6 inches wide, according to your pasta maker's instructions.
8. Lay the piece of dough lengthwise on a floured work surface. Place teaspoon-sized dollops of filling about 2 inches apart in the center of the bottom half of the dough.
9. Use your finger to moisten the area around each dollop of filling, then fold the top half of the dough over the filling to meet the other edge. Press down around each dollop of filling, making sure to press out any air bubbles.
10. With a sharp knife, a pasta cutter, or a small pizza cutter, cut each ravioli apart by making a cut halfway between each portion of filling, as well as trimming the bottom edge of the pasta.
11. Place ravioli on a parchment-lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining pasta dough and filling. At this point, the pasta can be refrigerated, covered with plastic wrap, for up to a day.
12. To cook the pasta, add 1 tablespoon salt to the stockpot of boiling water. Drop the ravioli into the boiling water.
13. Cook in boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the pasta floats to the surface.
14. Serve with the sauce or topping of your choice, such as chanterelles, sun-dried tomatoes, or kalamata olive sauce.

### Notes

- A small cookie scoop, such as the OXO Cookie Scoop, is perfect for portioning filling onto the rolled-out pasta dough.
