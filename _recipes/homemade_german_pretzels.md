I've made these homemade German pretzels several times over the years. This authentic German pretzel recipe is easy to make at home and you'll love them!

### Ingredients

* `480g` all-purpose flour
* `2 tsp` salt
* `1 tsp` sugar
* `236g` lukewarm water
* `2 pkgs` active dry yeast (4 1/2 teaspoons)
* `3 tbsp` butter
* Coarse salt for sprinkling

#### Lye Solution:

* `20g` sodium hydroxide U.S.P. –N.F. (food-grade hydroxide lye micro beads)
* `½ quart` of hot water

### Directions

1. Dissolve yeast in the lukewarm water. Mix flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Form a well in the flour mixture then add the sugar to the center of the well. Pour the yeast/water mixture into the well. Add the softened butter to the mixing bowl and knead everything to a smooth dough.
2. Let proof for 30 minutes.
3. Cut the dough into 10 equal parts, then roll each piece on the table (don't flour the surface, you shouldn't need it) to about 20 inches, tapered toward the ends. Don't make it smaller than 20 inches as it's impossible to get a good shape with a short, thick rope of dough. The dough should not get too warm as you roll it out, or it might tear.
4. To form the pretzel shape, place dough rope on parchment lined cookie sheet so that it creates the shape of the letter "U". Take both ends of the "U" and cross them over each other twice forming a twist. Bring that twist down and place it over the bottom curve of the "U".
5. Place the pretzels without covering them in the fridge for about an hour. This helps build a skin that will absorb the dipping solution better and make a beautiful shiny crust.
6. Preheat the oven to 450 F.
7. Score the dough once like for a baguette with a razor blade or sharp knife.
8. Sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake the pretzels for about 15 to 20 minutes (mine took 20 minutes for a nice dark crust), depending on how dark you like them.

### Lye Solution:

To make the lye solution, add a little bit of lye at a time to the hot water. Follow instructions on the box, and wear protective gloves and eyewear at all times. Wearing rubber gloves, and using tongs or a large spatula, dip the pretzel in the lye solution. Place pretzels on silpat mats or buttered parchment paper on stainless-steel baking sheets (not directly on aluminum!). Sprinkle pretzels evenly with pretzel salt. Bake at 450 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.
