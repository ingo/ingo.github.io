While traditional Irish Shepherd’s Pie calls for ground lamb, this recipe allows for either ground beef or lamb. The meat is cooked with vegetables in a rich gravy, then topped with cheesy mashed potatoes and baked until golden. Perfect for a hearty family dinner or a special occasion like St. Patrick's Day!

### Ingredients

#### Meat Filling:

* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* `1 cup` chopped yellow onion
* `1 lb.` 90% lean ground beef -or ground lamb
* `2 tsp` dried parsley leaves
* `1 tsp` dried rosemary leaves
* `1 tsp` dried thyme leaves
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `1/2 tsp` ground black pepper
* `1 tbsp` Worcestershire sauce
* `2` garlic cloves -minced
* `2 tbsp` all purpose flour
* `2 tbsp` tomato paste
* `1 cup` beef broth
* `1 cup` frozen mixed peas & carrots
* `1/2 cup` frozen corn kernels

#### Potato Topping:

* `1 1/2 - 2 lb.` russet potatoes -about 2 large potatoes peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
* `8 tbsp` unsalted butter -1 stick
* `1/3 cup` half & half
* `1/2 tsp` garlic powder
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `1/4 tsp` ground black pepper
* `1/4 cup` parmesan cheese

### Directions

#### Make the Meat Filling.

1. Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.
3. Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.
5. Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

#### Make the potato topping.

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.
2. Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.
3. Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.
4. Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.

#### Assemble the casserole.

1. Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.
2. If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesn’t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.

### Notes

* If you can’t find frozen mixed peas and carrots, you could use 1/2 cup frozen peas and 1/2 cup frozen sliced carrots.
