### Ingredients

* `2-3` cucumbers
* `To taste` Kosher salt
* `To taste` Sugar
* `To taste` Distilled vinegar
* `To taste` Pepper
* `To taste` Caraway seeds (optional)

### Directions

1. Peel the cucumbers. Slice wafer-thin using a mandoline. Place in a colander, sprinkle with salt, mix, and leave to drain for at least an hour.
2. Rinse briefly, drain. Place in bowl, and add sugar and vinegar (start with 1 tbsp vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, then modify to taste). Add pepper and caraway seeds (Jane doesn't like them, but Ingo finds them indispensable, and they are typically German).

### Notes

This salad pairs well with spicy foods. Adjust the amount of vinegar, sugar, pepper, and caraway seeds to your taste.
