title: Thai BBQ Ribs w/Peanut BBQ Sauce + Sweet Thai Ginger Slaw
---

This recipe is a delightful fusion of Thai flavors with classic BBQ ribs. The ribs are marinated overnight in a flavorful mix, slow-cooked until tender, and then grilled to perfection. The Peanut BBQ Sauce adds a nutty, savory twist, and the Sweet Thai Ginger Slaw provides a refreshing crunch. Grab some napkins â€“ things are going to get deliciously messy!

### Ingredients

* `5 pounds` (2 racks) baby back or St. Louis Style Ribs
* `1 1/2 cups` sweet thai chili sauce
* `3/4 cup` soy sauce
* `2 tablespoons` thai red curry paste
* `2 teaspoons` fish sauce
* `2 tablespoons` fresh ginger, grated
* `2 cloves` garlic, minced or grated
* pinch of pepper

#### Peanut BBQ Sauce

* `1/2 cup` soy sauce
* `1/2 cup` ketchup
* `1/3 cup` creamy peanut butter, warmed/melted
* `1/4 cup` sweet thai chili sauce
* `2 tablespoons` rice vinegar
* `2 teaspoons` thai red curry paste
* `1/2-1 tablespoon` Chinese 5 spice
* `1` lime, juice
* `1/4 cup` cilantro, chopped

#### Sweet Thai Ginger Slaw

* `4 cups` cabbage (use both green and purple), shredded
* `1` zucchini, cut into strips
* `1` red pepper, cut into strips
* `1` orange pepper. cut into strips
* `1` large jalapeno, seeded + chopped
* `1/2 cup` fresh cilantro, chopped
* `1/2 cup` fresh basil, chopped
* `2` lime, juiced
* `1/4 cup` rice wine vinegar
* `2 tablespoons` sweet thai chili sauce
* `1-2 tablespoons` peanut butter ( used 2), warmed/melted
* `1 tablespoon` fish sauce
* `1 tablespoon` soy sauce
* `1 tablespoon` fresh ginger, grated
* `1/2 cup` salted peanuts, chopped

### Directions

1. If using baby back ribs take a butter knife, wedge it just underneath the membrane to loosen and pull the membrane up and off the bone. Then just use your hands to pull the rest of the membrane off.
2. Place the ribs in a large baking dish or roasting pan.
3. In a large 4 cup glass measuring cup or bowl combine the sweet thai chili sauce, soy sauce, red curry paste, fish sauce, ginger, garlic and pepper. Whisk to combine and then pour the marinade over the ribs. Place the ribs in the fridge overnight, turning then once or twice if possible to make sure they get fully covered in the marinade.
4. The next morning or afternoon (depending on when you plan to eat) preheat the oven 300 degrees F. Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and bake for 2 1/2-6 hours (if you go the full six hours bake them at 275 degrees F.) or until very tender. Try to baste the ribs once or twice during cooking. During this time I prepare the BBQ sauce and slaw (recipes below).
5. When the ribs are done cooking preheat the grill to medium high heat and grease the grates. Remove the ribs from the baking dish and place them a baking sheet or large tray. Cover the ribs in the Peanut BBQ sauce (recipe below) and grill 3-5 minutes per side or until lightly charred. Be careful flipping the ribs as the will be very tender. Serve the ribs with more Peanut BBQ sauce and the Thai Slaw (recipes below).
6. Peanut BBQ Sauce
7. In a large glass measuring cup or bowl whisk together the soy sauce, ketchup, warm/melted peanut butter, sweet thai chili sauce, rice vinegar, thai red curry paste, Chinese 5 spice, lime juice and cilantro. If the sauce is not mixing place it in the microwave or over the stove and warm until everything is melted together. If the sauce is to thick add water to your liking.
8. Thai Peanut Slaw
9. Add the cabbage, zucchini, red pepper, orange pepper, jalapeno, cilantro and basil to a large bowl. In another small bowl whisk together the lime juice, rice wine vinegar, sweet thai chili sauce, warmed/melted peanut butter, fish sauce, soy sauce and fresh ginger. Pour the dressing over the slaw and toss well to coat. Place in the fridge until ready to serve and then add the peanut. The slaw can be made the night before.
