This recipe yields two 875g loaves with a mild sour tang and a chewy crust. This is a classic San Francisco sourdough recipe, shared by Mike Giraudo and tested by a home baker. The recipe was followed to the letter, with the exception of kneading by hand instead of using a stand mixer. The result is a bread with a mild sour tang and a chewy crust.

### Ingredients

* `250g` starter (60% hydration)
* `600g` water
* `1000g` flour
* `20g` salt

### Directions

1. Mix all ingredients for 2 minutes on low speed until mixed, then mix 9 more minutes on next level speed. 
2. Perform a quick stretch and fold, rest dough for 30 mins, then stretch and fold one more time.
3. Cover and let dough rest for about 8 hours at room temperature.
4. After 8 hours, divide and shape into loaves and then into bannetons or lightly oiled containers, cover- then into the refrigerator for at least 12 - 32 hours. (The longer the time, the more sour the bread)
5. After refrigeration, place immediately into a pre-heated Dutch oven @475 for 20 mins and then uncover and cook for another 10 mins @450 (or until you like the color of your bread). 

### Notes

* The starter was forked to 60% hydration 24 hours before the start of the recipe.
* The "room temperature" for the bulk proof averaged to 19C.
* The refrigerated proof time ended up being 25.5 hours. 
* The loaves were baked slightly longer because the color was too pale after only 30 minutes.
* The bread has a mild sour tang, which is pleasant and enough to make you go back for more. It's very close to the taste of San Francisco sourdough.
