### Ingredients

* Chicken pieces
* `Soy sauce` for marination
* `Sherry` for marination
* `Sugar` for marination
* `Minced ginger` for marination
* `Chopped cilantro` for marination
* `1/2 cup` Bisquick
* `2/3 cup` corn starch
* `2 tsp` baking powder
* Water

### Directions

1. Marinate chicken pieces overnight in soy sauce, sherry, sugar, minced ginger, and chopped cilantro. The marinade will be like a thin teriyaki sauce, but with a distinct sherry, cilantro, ginger presence. Turn the chicken over a few times while it marinates.
2. Make a thin batter from the Bisquick, corn starch, baking powder, and water.
3. Remove the chicken from the marinade. Keep whatever cilantro and ginger that sticks to the chicken. It tastes better if you don’t remove it.
4. Dip the chicken in the batter and deep fry until golden brown.

### Notes

This fried chicken is a must-have for any of our parties. Everybody expects to have it on the menu.
