Pita chips have Middle Eastern origins, as they are derived from pita bread, a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine. Pita bread is a round, pocket-like bread that can be split open to hold fillings or used as a dipping bread.

### Ingredients

* `2-4` pitas, cut into wedges (approximately 10 wedges per pita)
* `1 tbsp` olive oil
* Seasoning (Pepper Plant spice mix from San Luis Obispo is a favorite)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
2. Place cut pitas into a bowl. Drizzle with oil and salt. Toss to coat. 
3. Place on cookie sheet and place in oven for 10-15 minutes until golden (watch burning!). 
4. Remove from oven. Toss with favorite seasoning and serve.
