For best results, use a Pekin breed duck. Maltose syrup can be found in most Chinese supermarkets. If you can't find it, honey can be used in its place. To handle maltose, keep your hands and measuring equipment wet at all times, and work quickly.

### Ingredients

* For the Duck:
  * `1` whole duck, about 4 pounds
  * `1/4 cup` maltose syrup or honey
  * `2 tsp` soy sauce
  * `2 tbsp` kosher salt
  * `2 tsp` baking powder
  * `1` 16-ounce tall boy of beer, emptied and refilled half way with water
* To Serve:
  * `6` scallions, white and light green parts only, finely sliced lengthwise
  * `1` small cucumber, seeded and cut into 4-inch long matchsticks

### Directions

1. Dry duck carefully with paper towels and place on wire rack set in foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Using fingers or dull handle of a wooden spoon, carefully separate skin from breast meat by inserting fingers through bottom of breasts and slowly working your way up. Be careful not to tear skin. Combine maltose and soy sauce with 1 tablespoon water in small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until maltose is softened, about 20 seconds. Stir together mixture with spoon until homogeneous. Spoon mixture over duck and rub over entire surface, making sure to coat all exposed skin. Refrigerate duck, uncovered, at least 12 and up to 36 hours until surface is completely dry with leathery appearance.
2. Brine in `3/4 cup` sugar, `3/4 cup` salt, `2 tbsp` molasses, `5` star anise pods for 5 hours.
3. 1 hour before starting to grill, place the duck on the rotisserie skewer.
4. Use a hair dryer on high and blow dry the duck all over for 8 minutes.
5. Grill until breast reaches a temp of 160.
