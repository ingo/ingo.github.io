description: Horchata is a creamy, refreshing beverage originating in Latin America,
  made from soaked rice and spices like cinnamon and vanilla. This version is dairy-free,
  using ice to achieve a frothy, milkshake-like texture. It's lightly sweetened and
  perfect to accompany Mexican food on a hot day. This is our attempt to replicate
  the one from La Super-Rica Taqueria.

### Ingredients

* `1 c.` long grain rice
* `4 c.` whole milk
* `½ c.` sugar
* `1 tsp.` vanilla extract or paste (you can buy the vanilla paste at Trader Joe's, or use the seeds of a vanilla bean and let the bean soak overnight)
* `1` cinnamon stick, broken into large pieces (Mexican cinnamon, not Chinese--it's the brittle kind)

### Directions

1. Place the rice in a bowl with enough hot water to cover by 1 inch. Let the rice sit overnight.
2. Next day, pour off the water and reserve the water. Add enough fresh water to the reserved water to make 1 cup.
3. Place ½ cup of the rice water, ½ the soaked rice, and 2 cups milk in a blender. Blend until rice is all ground up. Do the same with the other half of the ingredients. Strain through 1 layer of cheesecloth.
4. If it seems too thick for your taste, strain through 2 or 3 layers of cheesecloth, as desired. Add sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon stick. It is better if left overnight again to “improve,” as it gets richer in flavor. Serve over ice.
