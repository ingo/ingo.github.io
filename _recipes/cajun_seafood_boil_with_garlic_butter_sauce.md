It's a feast that's sure to impress at your next gathering.

### Ingredients

#### For the cajun seafood boil
* `3 quarts` water
* `1 (12-ounce)` can of beer (*optional but highly recommended*)
* `3 tbsp` Creole Cajun Seasoning – homemade or store-bought
* `1 tbsp` Old Bay seasoning
* Hot sauce, to taste
* `1` medium yellow onion, roughly sliced into half-moons
* `1` large lemon, cut into wedges- plus more for serving
* `12 ounces` andouille sausage, sliced into rounds
* `1 lb` baby potatoes, red or gold (or a mix of both)
* `1 – 1 ½ lbs` jumbo shrimp, deveined, *shell-on or peeled*
* `4 - 6` ears of sweet corn on the cob, I use the mini ones

### Seafood options (pick one or more)
* `1 lb` pre-cooked snow crab leg clusters, fresh or frozen 
* `1-2` live Dungeness crabs, cleaned and halved
* `1-2` live spiny lobsters

#### For the garlic butter sauce
* `1 cup (2 sticks)` unsalted butter
* `10` cloves of garlic, finely minced or pressed
* `2 tbsp` lemon juice, freshly squeezed
* `1 tbsp` Old Bay seasoning
* `1 tbsp` fresh chopped parsley
* `1 tsp` Creole Cajun Seasoning – homemade or store-bought
* `1 tsp` smoked paprika
* Hot sauce, to taste

### Directions

1. In an extra-large stockpot or Dutch oven (about 10 quarts or larger) over medium-high heat, combine the water and beer (if using). Bring the liquid to a boil.
2. Season the boil with the Creole Cajun seasoning, Old Bay seasoning, and a few dashes of hot sauce- to taste. Add the sliced onion and lemon wedges to the pot. Stir all the ingredients well to thoroughly combine. Let the mixture boil for 15 minutes.
3. Carefully add the andouille sausage rounds and baby potatoes into the pot, stirring well to fully combine with the boil. Let the andouille and potatoes cook for 15-20 minutes- or until the potatoes are just about fork-tender.
4. Place the corn on the cob into the pot.
5. If using snow crab, gently nestle the snow crab clusters into the pot. Be sure that everything is fully submerged under the boil and carefully stir to ensure all ingredients are well combined. Continue boiling for another 5-7 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the garlic butter sauce.
6. If using Dungeness crab, gently place the crab on top. Continue boiling for another 7 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the garlic butter sauce.
7. If using lobster, prepare the lobster on the grill (we find it better this way) and then place it on the prepared final dish once completed.
8. On a separate burner, in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, garlic, lemon juice, Old Bay seasoning, parsley, Creole Cajun seasoning, smoked paprika, and hot sauce- to taste. Stir all ingredients and simmer the sauce until the butter melts and the sauce is well combined, stirring often, about 5-7 minutes. Then remove from the heat.
9. Line an extra-large baking sheet with foil/parchment paper (or newspaper if you’d like!). Use a spider strainer to remove the seafood boil contents from the pot and place onto the prepared baking sheet - remove and discard the onion/lemon bits.
10. Put the shrimp into the boil liquid and let them poach for 2-3 minutes until bright pink.
11. Remove the shrimp with the spider strainer and place them onto the baking sheet.
12. *Note:**If you’d like your garlic butter sauce to be thinner, you can add some of the seafood boil broth to adjust to the desired consistency.* Pour the garlic butter sauce over the seafood boil ingredients. Then use your hands (fitted with disposable gloves if desired) to toss the sauce with everything, smothering every nook and cranny in sauce.
13. Serve the Cajun seafood boil as-is with everyone just grabbing what they’d like from the baking sheet directly (it’s the chaos and messiness of seafood boils that are so fun!) or divide the boil onto individual plates to serve if you prefer. Serve immediately with lemon wedges, *if desired*. Be sure to sop up any runaway garlic butter sauce.
