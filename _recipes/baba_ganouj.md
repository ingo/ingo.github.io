Tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and garlic round it out. Much more flavorful than the store-bought version. Serve with warm pita for dipping, raw vegetable crudites, or even on sandwiches in place of mayo.

### Ingredients

* `2 lbs.` eggplants
* `3` cloves garlic
* Salt
* `4 tbsp.` tahina (sesame paste)
* Juice of `2` lemons
* `1/2 tsp.` ground cumin
* Olive oil

### Directions

1. Heat the broiler. Broil the eggplants (be sure to pierce the eggplant in a few places before broiling to avoid eggplant explosions) until charred on all sides and very soft. 
2. Remove and place in a paper bag. Once cool, remove skin and mash in colander with a folk, allowing extra juice to seep away. 
3. Pour eggplant into a mixing bowl and add garlic, a pinch of salt, tahina and lemon juice. Adjust flavoring to taste.
4. Place mixture in shallow bowl and lightly drizzle with olive oil. This is best served lukewarm.
