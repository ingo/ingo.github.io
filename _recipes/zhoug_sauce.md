Zhoug, pronounced Zoog, is a spicy, green chili cilantro sauce that hails from Yemen. It has become wildly popular in Israel and Middle Eastern cuisine to give dishes a huge burst of flavor. This simplified version of Zhoug is made with milder chilies, jalapeños versus hotter bird’s eye or serrano chilies. This version can also be made in a food processor to save time. It literally takes 5 minutes!

### Ingredients

* `1–3` whole jalapenos, sliced (start with one, if unsure)
* `2` fat garlic cloves
* `1` bunch cilantro, small stems ok
* `½ tsp` ground cardamon (or whole, see notes)
* `1 tsp` cumin
* `½ tsp` kosher salt, more to taste
* `1/3 cup` olive oil, more to desired consistency
* `2 tbsp` fresh lemon juice
* `½ tsp` chili flakes (Aleppo chili is nice), more to taste (optional)

### Directions

1. Place all ingredients (except oil) in a food processor and pulse until it’s uniformly chopped.
2. Add oil and lemon juice process into a coarse paste. For a looser version, add a bit more oil.
3. Taste for salt and heat, adding more if necessary. Add chili flakes if you like.
4. Store in a sealed jar in the fridge for up to a week.

### Notes

- Feel free to use whole cardamon seeds, whole cumin seeds and peppercorns– toasting and grinding. Caraway seeds are a nice touch too. Jalapeños are not traditional, yet produce a very consistent and milder heat. You can swap them out for hotter chilies. Feel free to swap out the cilantro for flat-leaf parsley, or even fresh mint. You can also do a blend of all three! The cardamom is the star here, so make sure you use enough so you can taste it.

To Make Zhoug Yogurt, mix 1-2 tablespoons with a cup of yogurt. Taste, adjust salt.
