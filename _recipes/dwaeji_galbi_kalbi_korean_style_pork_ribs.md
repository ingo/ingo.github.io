This recipe for Dwaeji Galbi, or Korean-style pork ribs, is a favorite for BBQ gatherings. The ribs are marinated in two different Korean sauces – one sweet and savory, the other spicy and slightly sweet – and then grilled to perfection. The secret to these tasty ribs is the use of lots of fresh garlic and ginger.

### Ingredients

Sweet and Savory Marinade:
* `1/2 cup` soy sauce
* `2/3 cup` water
* `1/4 cup` rice wine (or mirin)
* `2 tbsp` sesame oil
* `4 tbsp` honey
* `3 tbsp` brown sugar (preferably dark brown)
* `3 tbsp` minced garlic
* `2 tbsp` grated ginger
* `1/2` medium onion, grated
* `1/2` medium sweet apple (Fuji, Gala, or Golden Delicious), grated
* `1/2 tsp` black pepper

Spicy Marinade:
* `2/3 cup` Korean red/hot pepper paste (gochujang – adjust to your taste)
* `1/4 cup` soy sauce
* `1/4 cup` rice wine (or mirin)
* `2 tbsp` sesame oil
* `4 tbsp` honey
* `2 tbsp` brown sugar (preferably dark brown)
* `3 tbsp` minced garlic
* `2 tbsp` grated ginger
* `1/2` medium onion, grated
* `1/2` medium sweet apple (Fuji, Gala, or Golden Delicious), grated
* `1/2 tsp` black pepper

### Directions

1. Prepare the ingredients for the marinade you have chosen to make. Mix all of the ingredients well.
2. Cut each slab of the ribs into two pieces for easier handling. Rinse the ribs and drain. Coat the ribs well with the marinade, and marinate them for at least six hours (preferably overnight). Turn them over once after half of the marinating time has passed.
3. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange the ribs, meat side down, on a baking sheet. Cover the baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil. Bake them for 1.5 hours. (you can bake them 30 additional minutes if you want fall off the bones tenderness). Remove the foil cover.
4. At this point, you can finish off the ribs by one of the following two steps:
   1. Change the oven setting to broil and preheat for a few minutes. Then broil the ribs for 4 – 6 minutes on each side, or until the ribs are slightly charred, and the sauce is caramelized. Baste the ribs with the sauce while broiling.
   2. Preheat the grill and grill the ribs over medium heat for 5 – 8 minutes on each side, or until the ribs are slightly charred and the sauce is caramelized. Baste the ribs with the sauce while grilling.
