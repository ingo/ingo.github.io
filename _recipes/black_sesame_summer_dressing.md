description: A light Asian-inspired salad dressing that works beautifully over simple
  greens or more complex salads. Toasted black sesame seeds give it nutty flavor and
  crunch. Rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger add sweet, salty, nutty notes.
  The dressing has an amazing ability to elevate basic salads into something craveable.
  The sesame seeds provide texture and richness, while the vinegar and soy offer tangy
  brightness. Toss with your favorite summer vegetables.
