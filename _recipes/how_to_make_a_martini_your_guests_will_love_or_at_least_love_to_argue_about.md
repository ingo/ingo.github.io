title: How to make a martini your guests will love
---
The martini is a classic cocktail that has sparked many debates over the years. From the gin vs vodka argument to the shaken vs stirred controversy, everyone seems to have their own opinion on how to make the perfect martini. This guide will help you navigate these debates and make a martini that your guests will love — or at least love to argue about.

### Ingredients

* `2 cups` dry gin
* `2/3 cup` dry vermouth
* `2/3 cup` cold water
* Assorted orange bitters, olives and olive brine, lemon twists and/or cocktail onions, for serving

### Directions

1. Set up an empty 750-milliliter bottle with a funnel on top.
2. Pour the gin, vermouth and water into the bottle, then seal and shake to combine.
3. Store the bottle in the freezer for at least 90 minutes and up to 6 months.
4. Before service, chill glasses for 5 to 10 minutes.
5. When ready to serve, customize the drinks based on individual preferences: Add a dash or two of orange bitters, or a splash of olive juice if they like a “dirty” martini. Garnish with a lemon twist, an olive or a cocktail onion (a variation known as a Gibson) — or some combination of these.

### Notes

- Remember, ingredients vary. If you delve more deeply into martinis, tasting for nuances of flavor, you’ll start to understand why people still argue about them. One gin is not the same as the next. Ditto the vermouth, ditto the bitters, and each combines with the other ingredients a little bit differently. You can use the same classic spec and still end up with different drinks.
