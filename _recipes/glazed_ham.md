description: A more recent find, cooked with great success. Save the bone when done
  for use in soups. Cooking ham this way (as opposed to using a pre-sliced ham with
  ore-packaged) glaze is not only much cheaper, but much tastier as well.

### Ingredients

* `1` bone-in half ham (7-9 lbs.) with as much surface fat as possible. Use a "Smithfield" or "John Morrell" ham. Either the butt or shank side is fine, but the shank will most likely be juicier.
* Orange Marmalade Glaze

### Directions

1. Place oven rack in lowest position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Score fat to create a diamond pattern on surface. Cut a piece of aluminum foil to match the shape of the scored area and place over cut area.
2. Cover a roasting pan with foil, and place ham on wire rack, scored side up, inside pan. Bake ham until scores are pronounced. 
3. Remove ham from oven, brush with glaze and return to oven, replacing foil. Bake 2 1/2 hours more. 
4. Remove foil from surface and roast, basting with pan drippings a few times until a meat thermometer registers 140 degrees (approx. 30 mins more)
