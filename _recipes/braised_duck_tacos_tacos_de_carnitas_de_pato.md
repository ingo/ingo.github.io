### Ingredients

* `3 lb` duck legs
* `1 1⁄2 tsp` kosher salt, plus more to taste
* `1` head garlic, halved horizontally
* `1` large white onion, thinly sliced, plus one small, finely chopped
* `1 (4")` piece Mexican cinnamon, broken in half
* `1` medium orange, quartered
* `12` corn tortillas, warmed
* `3⁄4 cup` roughly chopped cilantro
* Lime wedges, for serving
* [Salsa](http://www.saveur.com/recipes-search?string=salsa), such as tomatillo and pineapple or peach pico de gallo, for serving (optional)

### Directions

1. Heat oven to 350°. Combine duck, 1 1⁄2 tbsp. salt, plus garlic, sliced onion, and cinnamon in a 6-qt. Dutch oven. Squeeze the orange quarters over the duck and add the spent oranges to the pot; toss to combine and arrange duck skin side up. Cook, covered, until duck is very tender, about 2 1⁄2–3 hours. 
2. Let duck cool in the pot, then transfer to a cutting board. Shred meat into large chunks, discarding skin and bones. Strain pan drippings through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring cup; chill until fat solidifies on the surface.
3. Then follow the carnitas recipe (pour over a little milk, let caramelize, and then pour over reserved liquid and let crisp) [Carnitas Recipe](http://www.muschenetz.com/tablem/index.php/carnitas/)
