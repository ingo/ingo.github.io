Börek is a popular pastry in Turkey, commonly enjoyed with a glass of tea at bakeries in Istanbul. Originating from the Ottoman Empire, börek is made with thin yufka dough and can be filled with a variety of ingredients. This recipe focuses on the rose-shaped börek, filled with spinach and cheese.

### Ingredients

* `2-3 full sheets` Yufka dough, quartered
* `1 lb (1/2 kilogram)` Spinach, chopped
* `1 each` Onion, grated
* `3 1/2 oz (100 grams)` Beyaz or Feta cheese, crumbled (or more if you want them cheesier)
* `3 each` Eggs, split
* `3 large spoonfuls` Yogurt
* `1/4 cup (60 ml)` Olive oil (plus more for greasing pan)
* `1/4 cup (60 ml)` Water
* `1 tsp (5 grams)` Black pepper
* `1 tbsp` Nigella seeds (çörek otu)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).
2. In a large bowl, mix spinach, grated onion, 1 egg, and black pepper.
3. In a small bowl, mix 2 spoons yogurt, 1 egg, oil, and water.
4. Take one piece of the cut yufka (should be triangle-shaped) and place some of the spinach mixture along the wide bottom. Next add some crumbled cheese and a 1-2 large spoonfuls of the egg/yogurt mixture. Begin gently rolling from the bottom to get a large coil, and then roll that coil into itself to form a rose shape. Tuck the lose end piece into the bottom-center of the rose.
5. Place onto a greased baking tray and begin to make your next börek. Continue until you run out of filling.
6. In another small bowl, mix 1 egg and 1 large spoonful of yogurt. Using a brush, paint this mixture over the tops of the roses.
7. Sprinkle with nigella seeds.
8. Place in oven and bake for 30-45 minutes. The tops of the roses should be golden brown.

### Notes

- Börek can come in many shapes and be filled with a variety of different fillings. The most common fillings are beyaz peynir (white cheese), kıyma (ground beef), and ıspanak (spinach).
