description: Morel mushrooms add deep, woodsy umami flavor to this creamy quiche enriched
  with gruyere cheese. Fresh asparagus spears on top keep their snap after baking.
  For the neatest slices, make quiche a day ahead; let it cool completely, then loosen
  edges and chill overnight. Cut perfect wedges, reheat and serve with a salad for
  brunch or lunch. Morels can be pricey but a little goes a long way. Their richness
  pairs wonderfully with the custardy quiche filling.

### Ingredients

* `1 1/2 cups` whole-wheat pastry flour or all-purpose flour
* `10 tbsp` cold butter, cut into chunks
* `3` large eggs
* `1/2 ounce` dried morel mushrooms
* `1 cup` slender asparagus, cut in 2-in. pieces
* `1 1/2 cups` half-and-half
* `3/4 tsp` salt
* `1/2 tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `1 cup` shredded gruyère cheese
* `1` green onion, finely chopped

### Directions

1. In a food processor, whirl flour and butter until mixture looks like cornmeal. Add 1 egg and whirl until dough holds together. Press evenly over bottom and 1 1/4 in. up side of a 9-in. springform pan; chill.
2. Preheat oven to 375°. Soak mushrooms in a small bowl with 1 cup hot water until softened, 15 to 20 minutes, swishing them around every so often. Gently squeeze out liquid. Cut in half lengthwise if large. Save liquid for another use.
3. Blanch asparagus in a saucepan of boiling water until barely tender-crisp, about 45 seconds. Drain, transfer to a bowl of ice water, and cool. Drain and pat dry.
4. In a bowl, whisk remaining 2 eggs to blend. Whisk in half-and-half, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle gruyère and onion in prepared crust, then arrange asparagus and morels on top. Pour egg mixture over vegetables.
5. Bake quiche on bottom rack until filling no longer jiggles when gently shaken, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool in pan on a rack at least 30 minutes. Loosen quiche from pan rim with a knife, remove rim, and slice. Serve warm or at room temperature.
