title: Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian Roasted Chicken)
---
Pollo a la Brasa is a popular dish in Peru, so much so that there's a designated national day for it in July! This recipe comes from a special request from a reader who wanted to recreate the delicious chicken she and her husband enjoyed at a local restaurant. The marinade is full of spices and herbs, creating a fragrant, savory, well-spiced, and somewhat salty flavor. The skin is beautifully crisp, and the meat is as juicy as one can imagine. 

### Ingredients

* `1` whole broiler/fryer chicken (2-3 pounds), or bone-in/skin-on chicken pieces of your choice

For the marinade:
* `2 tbsp` soy sauce
* Juice of `2` limes
* `5` cloves garlic
* `1 tsp` fresh ginger, minced
* `¼ cup` dark beer
* `1 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil
* `1 tsp` balsamic vinegar
* `1 tbsp` [huacatay paste](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AF0GATA?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00AF0GATA&linkCode=xm2&tag=thedargou09-20)
* `1 tbsp` [aji panca paste](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AF0CDFK?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00AF0CDFK&linkCode=xm2&tag=thedargou09-20)
* `1½ tsp` ground cumin
* `¾ tsp` [ground annatto](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GJPP6U?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B004GJPP6U&linkCode=xm2&tag=thedargou09-20), for the red color
* `1 tsp` dried oregano
* `1 tsp` dried rosemary
* `1 tsp` salt
* `½ tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `½ tsp` cayenne pepper (more or less according to heat preference)
* [Peruvian Aji Verde Sauce](https://www.daringgourmet.com/peruvian-aji-verde-sauce/), for serving

### Directions

1. Combine all the marinade ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth.
2. Loosen the skin on the chicken and rub some marinade under the skin. Place the chicken or chicken pieces in a large ziplock bag and pour the marinade over. Swish around to even coat the pieces. Marinate for at least 6 hours or overnight.
3. If using a convection oven (that's what I used): Note: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F and roast the chicken for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F and roast the chicken for another 15-20 minutes or until the internal temp reads 165 degrees F.
4. If using a conventional oven: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F and roast the chicken pieces on the middle rack of the oven until the internal temperature of the chicken reads 160 degrees F, about an 45 minutes. If the skin begins to brown too much, move the roasting pan to the bottom rack. You can also reduce the oven temperature.
5. Remove the chicken from the oven. It is recommended that you tent the chicken with foil for 10-15 minutes before serving. If using a whole chicken, cut the chicken into serving pieces.
6. Serve the chicken with [Peruvian Aji Verde Sauce.](https://www.daringgourmet.com/2013/09/24/peruvian-aji-verde-sauce/)
7. Traditional sides include a leafy salad and thickly cut French fries.

### Notes

* For all you BBQ'ers, this chicken is also fantastic barbecued over coals and wood chips!
* The oven-roasting instructions are for chicken pieces. If using a whole chicken, increase cooking time until internal temperature of chicken reaches 160 degrees F.
