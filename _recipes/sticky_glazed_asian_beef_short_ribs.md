title: Sticky Glazed Asian Beef Short Ribs
---
One evening during the recent fortnight of repetitive rain, Mr NQN was sitting in the passenger seat of our car with me at the driver's wheel. I dislike driving in the rain as it creates another hazard and it causes pedestrians to pop out of nowhere and do unpredictable things. "Why don't you bring a potato with you?" Mr NQN asked grinning like a monkey. I knew that he was waiting for me to ask him what he meant and suitably intrigued I asked him to explain.

### Ingredients

* `2 kilos` beef short ribs (cut flanken style across the bone or English style aka parallel to bone)
* `3/4 cup` light soy sauce
* `3/4 cup` dark soy sauce
* `2 cups` brown sugar, divided into two
* Salt to taste
* `6` garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
* `1 inch` piece of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
* `2` star anise
* `1` large red chilli
* `2 cups` water
* `1 tbsp` rice wine vinegar
* Boiled white rice to serve

### Directions

1. Mix the soy sauces, 1 cup of the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, garlic, ginger, star anise and chilli in a bowl and then marinate the beef ribs in the marinade for 1 hour. Drain the ribs, reserving the marinade for cooking.
2. Heat a frypan on high heat and sear the beef ribs until browned on all sides. You can technically skip this step and put the ribs straight into the crock pot, pressure or slow cooker but it adds flavour to the meat. Mix the marinade with the 2 cups of water and place this and the ribs in a lidded cast iron pot, pressure cooker or slow cooker. For a pressure cooker, cook on high pressure for 1 hour. For a slow cooker, cook for 8 hours, for a cast iron pot, cook for four hours in a 160C/320F oven for 3 hours.
3. I find this next step easiest if I place the ribs in a snug container with just enough liquid to cover them. Cool the rest of the liquid in another container and refrigerate both overnight. The next day, skim the fat off the top and reheat and serve with rice if you don't want to make the glaze. If you are making the glaze, take 500ml of the liquid to make the glaze and place in a saucepan and heat with the extra cup of brown sugar and rice wine vinegar\-taste and add more salt if needed. Reduce down to a syrupy glaze. Heat the ribs in about 1 cup of the liquid and then brush with the glaze. The remainder of the liquid can be frozen and used as a Chinese Masterstock.

### Notes

- This dish can last for several days and can also be put in sandwiches or frozen for later use.
