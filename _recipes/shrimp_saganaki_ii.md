title: Shrimp Saganaki II
---
This recipe comes from Peter Minaki, a Greek-Canadian chef who has traveled extensively throughout Greece. He was inspired to create this version of Shrimp Saganaki after tasting a memorable rendition at a taverna in N. Kallikratia, near his summer home in Halkidiki, Greece. This dish is best served as a shared appetizer with lots of crusty bread to mop up the sweet and savory tomato sauce.

### Ingredients

* `16` large whole shrimp, deveined
* `1/3 cup` extra virgin olive oil
* `4` scallions, thinly sliced
* `3` cloves of garlic, minced
* `3 cups` of grated ripe tomato (or homemade tomato sauce)
* `1/2 tsp` sea salt
* `1/2 tsp` ground black pepper
* `1 shot` of Ouzo (about 1/4 cup)
* `3/4 to 1 cup` crumbled Feta
* `2 tbsp` of thinly sliced scallion greens or finely chopped parsley
* sprinkle of chili flakes

### Directions

1. Place a large skillet on your stovetop over medium heat. Add the olive oil, scallions, garlic and a pinch of salt. Sweat for about 5-6 minutes or until softened.
2. Add the tomato puree, Ouzo, salt and pepper and bring up to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes or until most of the water has cooked off and you have a nice think sauce.
3. Place the shrimp onto the sauce, place the lid on and cook for 2-3 minutes or until shrimp have turned pink (if you have an oven safe skillet you can place in the oven and broil).
4. Top with crumbled feta, turn the heat off. Wait a couple of minutes then transfer to a platter. Add more Feta (if needed), scallions and chili flakes. Serve as an appetizer with a loaf of crusty bread for that sauce.
