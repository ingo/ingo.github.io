title: Hawaiian Style Macaroni Salad
---
A family recipe passed down through seven generations, this Hawaiian Style Macaroni Salad is a staple at picnics and barbecues. With a hint of curry and the addition of tuna, this isn't your average macaroni salad. The secret ingredient? Hard boiled egg yolks in the mayo for a richer texture.

### Ingredients

* `1 pound` elbow macaroni
* `1/2 cup` apple cider vinegar
* `2 cups` mayonnaise, divided
* `2 cups` whole milk, divided
* `1 tbsp` brown sugar
* `1 1/2 tsp` salt
* `2 tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `1 bunch` scallions, sliced thin (about 5-7 scallions)
* `1 1/2 cups` shredded carrot
* `1 1/2 cups` minced celery

### Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a roiling boil. Add macaroni and cook until very soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, return the pasta to the pot and immediately toss with vinegar. Let cool ten minutes.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together 1 cup of the mayonnaise, 1 1/2 cups of the whole milk, the brown sugar, salt, and pepper.
3. Once the macaroni has cooled for 10 minutes, toss with the mixed sauce and let cool to room temperature.
4. Once cool, fold in the scallion, carrot, and celery. Whisk together the remaining 1 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 cup whole milk and pour over macaroni salad. Toss well to coat. Taste and add more salt or pepper as needed.
5. Chill in the refrigerator until cold.

### Notes

* For a hint of spice, add a tsp of curry powder.
* For a classic local style, add 1/2 to 1 can of tuna.
* The real trick is to add 3 or 4 hard boiled egg yolks in the mayo. It gives the mayo a better texture and prevents it from being absorbed into the pasta as much. Some families chop up the egg whites and add them in as well.
