This curry, rooted in tradition and complexly flavored, is also approachable enough for a weeknight. It transforms cauliflower from a humble vegetable to a rich centerpiece with the addition of cashews, coconut, fresh ginger and a flurry of spices you’re likely to have in your pantry. Serve with rice for an exceptionally good vegan supper.

### Ingredients

* `1` (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
* `4` garlic cloves, chopped
* `1` green chile, roughly chopped (seeded if you prefer less heat)
* Kosher salt
* `4 tbsp` canola oil
* `2` large onions, finely chopped
* `1 tbsp` tomato paste
* `1 ½ tsp` ground coriander
* `1 ¼ tsp` ground cumin
* `½ tsp` chile powder
* `1` large head cauliflower (about 1 1/4 pounds), broken into bite-size florets
* `1` (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
* `4 oz` unsalted cashews (about 3/4 cup)
* `½ cup` frozen peas
* `½ tsp` garam masala
* `1` small bunch cilantro, leaves chopped, for serving
* `1` lemon wedge, for serving
* Cooked basmati rice, for serving

### Directions

1. Place the ginger, garlic and green chile in a mortar and pestle with a pinch of salt. Mash until a paste forms and set aside. Alternately, finely chop the ginger, garlic and green chile together, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, then mash into a coarse paste using the flat portion of your chef’s knife.
2. In a large skillet with a lid, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium. Cook the onions until golden, about 10 minutes. Add the ginger paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
3. Stir in the tomato paste, coriander, cumin, chile powder and 1 1/4 teaspoons salt. Stir in the cauliflower and coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until the cauliflower is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium. Fry the cashews, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.
5. Add the peas and garam masala to the cauliflower mixture and cook, stirring, 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt.
6. Top the curry with the cashews, cilantro and a squeeze of lemon just before serving. Serve with a big steaming bowl of basmati rice.
