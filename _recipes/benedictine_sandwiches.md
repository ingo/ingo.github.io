description: These dainty old-fashioned tea sandwiches feature cool cucumber slices,
  thinly sliced red onion, and a creamy herbed spread made with cream cheese or mayonnaise
  sandwiched between thin bread slices. The simple flavors combine into a refreshing
  nibble. The cucumber provides refreshing crispness, the onion a touch of bite, and
  the spread flavors everything without overpowering. Fingertip sandwiches don't get
  easier or more classic. Use very thin bread and minimal spread to keep these delicate.
  Trim the crusts for perfect little bites. The cucumber and onion provide pleasant
  contrasts in texture. The spread adds a creamy richness without dominating. These
  petite sandwiches are the essence of simplicity.
