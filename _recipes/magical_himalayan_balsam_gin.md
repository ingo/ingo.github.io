title: Magical Himalayan Balsam Gin
---
This Himalayan Balsam Gin recipe is a delightful surprise. The Himalayan Balsam is a highly invasive weed, but it's also a highly edible plant. The green seed pods, seeds, young leaves, shoots, and flowers are all edible. In this recipe, we use the flowers to create a gin infusion that changes color when tonic is added. 

### Ingredients

* `2 litres` Himalayan Balsam flowers
* Zest from `4` Limes
* `2` Dessertspoons Caster Sugar
* `1 litre` Gin
* A Large Glass Preserving Jar
* Glass Bottles

### Directions

1. Cut any green from the base of the flower and pop them all in a jar with the lime zest and gin. Leave to infuse in a dark, cool place for 24 hours.
2. Once the 24 hours are up, strain the gin into a clean jar, add the sugar and give it a shake to dissolve.

### Notes

- The resulting Himalayan Balsam Gin is a pale amber colour much like a traditional pink gin made from Angostura bitters. The flowers impart a light floral taste to the spirit which combines well with the lime. The real surprise comes when you add tonic to the gin - it turns a stunning, vibrant pink.
