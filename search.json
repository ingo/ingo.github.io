          "Brine the birds: Whisk the salt and sugar with the 10 cups of tepid water in a large mixing bowl or pot until the sugar and salt fully dissolve. Combine the garlic, peppercorns, ginger, and lemongrass in a mortar and lightly pound to bruise and slightly crush them. Add them along with the cilantro and green onions to the brine, then add the birds breast side down. If they float, weigh them down with a plate. If the birds still aren’t completely submerged, choose a different container. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or, even better, overnight.",
          "Cut the lemongrass crosswise (tough parts, too) into rough 1/8-inch slices. Firmly pound it in a granite mortar until it’s very fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add the garlic and pound to break it into small pieces (you’re not making a paste), about 20 seconds. Add the salt and pepper, pound briefly, then add the cilantro stems and pound to bruise them, about 10 seconds more.",
          "Make the stuffing and stuff the birds: Remove the birds, discarding the brine, and sit them ass down in a colander to drain.",
          "Divide the stuffing equally among the birds’ cavities, set the birds breast side up on a plate (or even better, a rack set over a tray) so there’s some space between them. Tuck each wing tip under the body. Put the birds in the fridge, uncovered, to dry out for at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours.",
          "Marinate the birds: Stir the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and pepper in a small bowl along with the 2 tablespoons of water until the sugar is fully dissolved. Brush the birds with the marinade, then put them back, uncovered, into the fridge for about 2 hours.",
          "Cook the birds on the grill (highly recommended): Prepare a charcoal grill to cook at 350°F to 375°F. If your grill doesn’t have a firebox, which allows for easy indirect cooking, push the coals to one side of the grill and form them into a mound. Add the birds, breasts up, to the grill rack opposite the charcoal, and cover the grill, opening the vents and rotating the grill cover if possible so the vents are directly over the birds. Positioning the open vents above the birds will pull the charcoal smoke toward them, giving them a little more smoky flavor. While you cook, you’ll have to add more charcoal as necessary to maintain the temperature.",
          "Cook for 25 minutes, flip the birds over to get some color on the other side, and after about 5 minutes more, flip the birds over again.",
          "If you’re not cooking on a grill with a firebox, carefully remove the birds and the grill grate. Spread out the coals so that instead of mound, they’re lying in one or two layers, still on one side of the grill. Return the grate and the birds to the grill.",
          "Continue cooking, covered, with the birds on the side opposite the coals. After 5 minutes, brush the birds all over with the shallot oil and re-cover. After 5 minutes more, brush the birds all over with the honey mixture and move them so they’re directly over the coals. Keep cooking, covered, turning over and rotating the birds as necessary to achieve even browning and brushing occasionally with the honey mixture, until the skin is a slightly glossy golden brown with some dark patches and the juices of the thigh run clear, 5 to 10 minutes more, depending on the size of the bird.",
          "In the oven: Move the oven rack to the bottom third of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350°F. Put the birds breast side up on a baking tray (or even better, a rack set over a tray or roasting pan).",
          "Roast the birds for 30 minutes. Rotate the pan and brush the birds all over with the shallot oil. Cook for 5 minutes more, then brush the birds all over with the honey mixture. Crank up the heat to 400°F. Check on the birds every 5 minutes, brushing them with the honey mixture, until the skin is a slightly glossy golden brown with some darker patches and the juices run clear when you pierce the thickest part of the thigh, about 10 minutes more, depending on the size of the bird.",
          "Rest and carve the birds: Let the birds rest for at least 10 minutes or up to 30 minutes. Serve them whole or carved—it’s up to you—with the dipping sauces. At Pok Pok, we halve the birds lengthwise, then remove the hindquarters and separate them into drumsticks and thighs, remove the wings, and chop the breast portions through the bone into two or three pieces."

With the mixer on low, add the salt, then the butter, a spoonful at a time, mixing until it’s incorporated into the dough. Then, mix on medium speed for 10 minutes until dough is completely smooth.

Roll out on a well-floured counter to about a 10-inch width and as long in length as you can when rolling it thin.

          "Divide into four and flatten to about 2½ cm or an inch. Take a bowl big enough to hold all four pieces of dough when you stack them on top of one another (I used a small saucepan). Pour a little vegetable oil into the bowl, place one piece of pastry into it, pour a little more oil over the it and repeat until all four are in the bowl.

Don’t go oiling up your wooden table! Take one disc of pastry from the oil, scrape off the oil, then place it onto your oiled work bench. With oiled hands, flatten the disc from the inside to outside until it is about 5 mm thick. Then place your fingers under the edge, gently grab, lift and stretch the dough outwards. Working your way around all of the edges, you’re basically stretching the disc to a diameter of 1 metre. It is quite elastic so just make sure your nails don’t pierce the dough otherwise it’ll tear, but no drama if you have a few holes.",

Leaving the thick edge intact will give you clumps of dough in the cooked burek, which you don’t want. Take the cheese filling and spread it over the folded dough in the centre.",

          "Divide into four and flatten to about 2½ cm or an inch. Take a bowl big enough to hold all four pieces of dough when you stack them on top of one another (I used a small saucepan). Pour a little vegetable oil into the bowl, place one piece of pastry into it, pour a little more oil over the it and repeat until all four are in the bowl. Pour enough vegetable oil over the top to virtually cover the stack of dough. Set aside for half an hour while you make the cheese filling.",

With oiled hands, flatten the disc from the inside to outside until it is about 5 mm thick.Then place your fingers under the edge, gently grab, lift and stretch the dough outwards. Working your way around all of the edges, you’re basically stretching the disc to a diameter of 1 metre.",

Incorporate by pulling the dough softly, turning it over, squeezing it, gently spinning it around in the bowl. Absorption will be slow but every dough decides for itself how fast to loosen up and incorporate the ingredients. Once the salted yeast mixture is incorporated, cover the bowl again and allow the dough to rise for 30 minutes.",
          "Uncover the bowl. With one wet hand, lightly grasp one edge of the dough. Pull the flap upward and outward, then attach to the top of the dough. Turn the bowl a 1/8th turn and repeat until you have rotated the bowl a complete turn.",

Then, place the dough in a clean bowl lightly greased with vegetable oil. Cover and set aside to rise for about 11 more hours at room temperature (20-21°C). The dough should almost triple in size.",

Pull the edges of each piece of dough and fold them onto the top of the ball, then turn each ball “seam-side” down on the work surface. Working one ball at a time, shape by gently rolling on the work surface.",

If you do not have a baking stone, a baking sheet turned upside down and heated together with the oven will work as a decent substitute. During the last 10 minutes of pre-heating, turn on the broiler element to further raise the temperature in the oven.",
          "Meanwhile, remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Working one dough ball at a time, place on a well-floured work surface, then sprinkle more flour on top. Form into a 6-inch diameter disc by pressing your fingertips into the dough leaving the edge untouched and the center portion just slightly thicker than the rest. Then, using the palms of your hands and working from the middle outwards, stretch and turn the dough until you have a 10-12-inch diameter disk.",
          "Place the shaped dough onto a pizza peel or onto an inverted baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Add a small handful of crushed ice on top of the dough, distributing evenly. Transfer the dough directly onto the baking stone or pre-heated baking sheet. The ice will melt, creating a moist base for the Pecorino. Bake for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the border is slightly charred. Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle liberally with Pecorino Romano. Season with black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately. Repeat with remaining dough."

I’ve been making Perfect Instant Pot Brown Rice; just the rice part, not the dressing. You need a wide pot or pan with a lid for this recipe. The wide shape of the wok is nice because the cooling rack can rest higher up in the pan, allowing water to simmer beneath it without hitting the fish. A whole fish fits nicely inside it, too. Depending on the size of your fish, you will need to adjust the timing. I’ve been using Branzino, and each Branzino has weighed about 1.25-1.5 lbs. For this size fish, 9 to 1o minutes steaming is about right. For a 2-lb fish, cook for about 16-20 minutes. Alana calls for Moi or other mild, white-fleshed fish."

          "Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly, until thickened, paste-like, and the spoon or spatula leaves lines on the bottom of the pan. This should take 1 to 3 minutes, depending on the strength of your burner.",
          "Remove from the heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl, the bowl of a stand mixer, or the bucket of a bread machine (whatever you plan to knead the dough in).",
          "To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the cold milk, then the flour and remaining ingredients to the mixing bowl in the order listed; the heat from the tangzhong will help to warm the cold milk.",
          "Mix — by hand, on low speed of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, or in a bread machine set to the dough cycle — to bring the dough together. Next, knead the dough until it’s smooth, elastic, and tacky.",
          "Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable cover.",
          "Let the dough rise until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 60 to 90 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen).",

          "Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper.",
          "To assemble the rolls: Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and press it into a 10” x 12” rectangle that’s about 1/2” thick. For evenly shaped rolls, try to pat the dough into an actual rectangle (with corners), rather than an oval.",
          "Sprinkle the filling over the dough, covering all but a 1/2” strip along one long side.",
          "Starting with the filling-covered long side, roll the dough into a log.",
          "Score the dough lightly into eight equal 1 1/2” to 2” pieces; this will make large, saucer-sized cinnamon rolls — their generous size is part of their charm. Cut the dough at the score marks. Dental floss will give you the cleanest cut: pull off a long piece of floss, loop it underneath the log at the score mark, and pull the ends in opposite directions to cut the dough. Repeat until you’ve cut all of the rolls. If you don’t have dental floss, a bench knife or sharp knife will work.",
          "Place the rolls onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them so there’s at least 2” between each one and they’re 2” away from the edges of the pan; a 3-2-3 arrangement works well. To prevent them from unraveling while they rise and bake, tuck the ends of the spirals underneath the rolls so that they’re held in place.",
          "Cover the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap or a reusable cover and let them rise for 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the warmth of your kitchen). The rolls should be puffy and the dough shouldn’t bounce back immediately when gently pressed.",
          "About 20 minutes before you’re ready to bake, position a rack in the top third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F.",
          "Bake the rolls for 14 to 18 minutes, until they’re a light golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one roll reads 190°F. Bake for the lesser amount of time for extra-soft rolls, and the longer amount of time for rolls with a bit more color and slightly firmer texture.",
          "Remove the rolls from the oven, place the pan on a rack, and brush the hot rolls with 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) of the melted butter. Let the rolls cool for 10 to 15 minutes before icing.",
          "To make the icing: Combine the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons (21g) melted butter with the remaining icing ingredients in a medium bowl, mixing with a spatula until smooth. Milk makes a lovely frosting; using cream in place of milk creates an extra layer of richness, while substituting buttermilk adds subtle tang, a nice counterpoint to the icing’s overall sweetness.",
          "Ice the rolls and serve immediately. If you’re planning to serve the rolls later, wait to ice them until just before serving. Store icing at room temperature, tightly covered, until you’re ready to use it.",
          "Store completely cooled rolls, un-iced and well wrapped, for a couple of days at room temperature; or freeze for up to 1 month."

Shredded coconut combines with sweetened condensed milk for the signature taste and texture. The macaroons emerge from the oven with a lovely golden exterior that cracks to reveal the soft coconut center. They’re everything you want from a coconut macaroon. As a coconut lover, I’ve tried dozens of recipes for coconut macaroons recipes over the years — be it for the holidays or for friends who eat gluten-free. These are my favorite. Chewy and moist on the inside, crisp and golden on the outside, they’re delicious plain but even more irresistible dipped in dark chocolate. They also keep well for days, making them the perfect treat to bake ahead or give away during the holidays.</p>",

Add the neck and giblets from the turkey and mixed chicken legs and thighs; season to taste with salt and pepper. Brown on both sides; transfer to a 6-quart pot. Pour half of the fat out of the skillet; heat over medium-high. Stir in 2 chopped yellow onions, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 2 whole cloves, 1 chopped carrot, and 1 chopped celery rib with leaves and cook until just browned, 12–14 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and add 1⁄4 cup of the calvados and 2 cups of the wine. Return to heat, bring to a boil, and scrape up the brown bits on the bottom of the skillet. Transfer the vegetable mixture to the 6-quart pot of meat. Add enough water to cover the mixture to a depth of 1\"; bring to a slow simmer. Partially cover and cook, without stirring, for 4–5 hours. (Add more water as necessary to keep solids covered.) Remove from heat, let cool, strain (as shown), and refrigerate broth. You should have about 12 cups.\n</p>",
          "<p>\nA day before serving, brine the turkey, calculating 1 hour of brining for each pound. In a large plastic brining bag or stockpot, combine 1 cup of the salt, brown sugar, and chile powder. Put 2 cups of the cider, 35 cloves garlic, and 4 unpeeled, cored, and coarsely chopped granny smith apples into a food processor and purée. Add purée to the brining bag along with 6 cups of the cider and 4 quarts cold water. Whisk to dissolve the salt and sugar.\n</p>",
          "<p>\nPut turkey into brining bag. The turkey must be kept cold (brine should be 33°), so refrigerate it or bury the bag in ice in an oversize cooler, adding ice as necessary. Before cooking, bring the turkey close to room temperature for the shortest roasting time. (Calculate 10 minutes’ roasting time per pound.)\n</p>",
          "<p>\nRemove the oven’s center rack and arrange the remaining rack as low as possible. Heat oven to 450°. Choose a large shallow roasting pan, ideally 2\" deep; if the pan is too deep, the turkey will steam instead of roasting. In the pan, cluster together remaining celery ribs halved crosswise, leaves removed; remaining 3 carrots halved crosswise, and remaining 3 onions cut into thick rounds so that the vegetables become a sturdy rack for the turkey. Scatter 1 unpeeled, cored, and coarsely chopped granny smith apple and 1 1⁄2 cups basil leaves over the top. Add 4 cups of the wine to cover the bottom of the pan with 1⁄2\" of liquid.\n</p>",
          "<p>\nRemove the turkey from the brine and pat it dry with paper towels. Set the turkey on the vegetables breast down (a technique that draws juices down into the breast while also protecting the meat from the heat) and tuck remaining unpeeled, cored, and coarsely chopped granny smith apple and remaining 1⁄2 cup basil leaves into the cavity. Dot the turkey with butter and dust all over with 1⁄2 tsp. pepper. Begin roasting.\n</p>",
          "<p>\nAs the bird cooks, baste it with the pan juices every 20 minutes using a spoon. After the first hour, remove the roasting pan from oven and, using two pot holders, carefully turn the turkey breast side up. Baste it with the pan juices and continue roasting. (Cover the turkey loosely with foil if it threatens to burn.) When an instant-read thermometer inserted in a thigh (without touching bone) reaches 165°–170° (after about 2 hours), move the turkey to a platter and let it rest in a warm place for 20 minutes.\n</p>",
          "<p>\nMeanwhile, set the roasting pan over 2 burners to make the gravy. Skim off excess fat from pan juices and remove two-thirds of the vegetables from the pan. Cut the rest of the vegetables into small pieces. Add remaining 1⁄3 cup calvados, remaining 1⁄2 cup wine, and remaining 1⁄3 cup cider. Bring to a boil over high heat and, using a wooden spatula to scrape up all the caramelized bits, cook the liquid down to a syrup, 6–8 minutes.\n</p>",
          "<p>\nRemove broth from refrigerator; skim off fat. Reheat all but 1 cup. Add two-thirds of the heated broth to the pan. Boil, stirring constantly, until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Stir the remainder of the heated broth into the pan and bring to a boil. To thicken the gravy, add flour to a tall glass. Stir the 1 cup of reserved, chilled broth into the flour until there are no lumps. You’ve made a slurry. Whisk it into the bubbling gravy. Keep simmering and whisking until gravy is smooth and thick enough to lightly coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. Now taste it. If you taste raw flour, simmer the gravy for another minute.\n</p>",
          "<p>\nStir 8 torn basil leaves into the gravy and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, if necessary. Pour the gravy into a bowl or another serving vessel. Carve the turkey and arrange on a large platter. Serve with the gravy passed separately.\n</p>"

Well, we discovered that, made with lard, these rolls have a distinctive “salami-like” smell and taste, which happens to pair perfectly with the fillings in a Cuban sandwich.

Working one breast at a time, place the chicken between 2 pieces of parchment paper and use a meat mallet (or the bottom of a pan) to pound the chicken evenly so it’s a scant 1/2-inch/1-centimeter thick.

Potato or tapioca starch is active at slightly lower temperatures than cornstarch and will produce a slightly more tender scramble, but cornstarch works just fine if it’s what you’ve got on hand. Make sure your skillet is at just the right temperature by heating a tablespoon of water in the skillet and waiting for it to evaporate. For creamier eggs, you can replace the water with milk or half-and-half.</p>",

Indeed, this cake is best baked, filled, frosted and refrigerated for at least an hour (or up to two days). Kind of like a madeleine, its layers are purposefully a bit dry, as they need to hold a dousing of orange juice and rum. The whipped cream filling and frosting is soft and dreamy. It’s an elegant celebration cake.</p>",

Breasts are a bit trickier because they are low in fat and can dry out quickly. But this technique works beautifully for both. If you have the time, dry brine in advance (see Tips). When ready to eat, grill the chicken longer on the first side to get a little color (if the breasts are uneven in thickness, pound them until they’re even first), finish cooking on the other side, then plunge it into a bright sauce for up to 30 minutes for added juiciness.</p>",

The lobster is drizzled with a vibrant green herbed oil, adding a pop of color against the white meat and dark char. A lemon wedge rests nearby, ready to be squeezed over the lobster for a fresh citrus kick. Shot on a rustic wooden surface with visible grain and scratches, evoking a relaxed, outdoor grilling atmosphere. Natural daylight from the side creates soft shadows and uneven highlights. The composition feels relaxed and slightly off-center, with scattered herbs and a used grilling brush adding to the authenticity. Editorial food photojournalism aesthetic, vibrant but not saturated, authentic, unposed, imperfect, as if captured mid-meal rather than staged.",

If you like it spicier, add some finely sliced chillis or dried chilli flakes. Save a couple of “drips” of the sauce mix to sprinkle on top. To eat with chopsticks, “smash” the stack” so it’s all combined and the crispy wonton wrappers are in bite-size pieces. Best one for dinner parties.",

Add enough grapeseed oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Once the pan and oil are hot, add 4-5 pieces of the cut and seasoned short ribs. Sear the beef on both sides for 2-3 minutes per side. The goal is to achieve a nice caramelization and crust. Remove the short ribs from the pan, and place them in a crock pot. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of beef stock, while scraping up any bits left behind. Reduce the beef stock by half, and then add it to the crock pot. Return the pan to medium-high heat, and repeat the above steps until all of the short ribs are seared and in the crock pot.",

Add in the remaining beef stock (1 1/2 cups), low sodium soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, mirin, minced ginger root, minced garlic, and crushed pineapple. Cook on low for 8 hours. Remove the Fullblood Wagyu short ribs from the crock pot, and place them in a bowl. Shred the beef with two forks. Put the juices from the crock pot in a large pot on the stove. Reduce the liquid down to 1 1/2 cups. Once the liquid is reduced, mix it into the bowl with the shredded Fullblood Wagyu short ribs.",
          "Mix together the all purpose flour, sugar, instant yeast, and kosher salt in a large bowl. Add in the milk, grapeseed oil, rice vinegar, and water. Mix into a dough, adding a little extra water if needed. Mix in a stand mixer with a dough hook for 5 minutes or until smooth. Then, cover with a damp cloth, and leave the dough to rise for 2 hours or until doubled in size.",
          "Tip the dough out onto a clean work surface, and punch it down. Flatten the dough with your hands, then sprinkle 1 teaspoon of baking powder over it. Knead for 5 minutes. Using a bench knife and kitchen scale, cut the dough and weigh it out to 1.7 ounce pieces. You should have 18 dough pieces total. In the palm of your hand, roll each dough piece into a round ball. Leave them to rest for 2-3 minutes.",
          "Using a rolling pin, roll out each dough ball, one by one, into an oval shape (about 3-4 mm thick). Rub the surface of the dough ovals with grapeseed oil. Then, brush a little oil over a chopstick. Place the oiled chopstick in the center of each oval. Fold the dough over the chopstick. Then, slowly pull out the chopstick. Cut 18 squares of baking parchment, and put a bun on each piece of parchment paper. Transfer the 18 buns to a baking tray. Cover with a clean tea towel or lightly oiled cling film. Leave in a warm place for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until doubled in size.",
          "Heat a large bamboo steamer over a medium-high heat. Steam the buns for 8 minutes until puffed up (you’ll need to do this in batches). Once steamed, open each bun and fill it with our Hawaiian style braised Fullblood Wagyu short ribs and pickled vegetables. Eat the steamed buns while they’re still warm. Enjoy!"

After two days you stop the fermentation by chilling it in the fridge. That’s it. The result is a cloudy, dry mixer with pinprick carbonation and a straight-up goose of fresh ginger. That is thrilling come dark ’n’ stormy hour, not just for its authenticity and superior flavor but also because you can now brag about your homemade ginger beer.</p>",

Knead it by hand a few times, then shape into a ball. Place the dough ball back into the mixing bowl and cover it with a damp towel or a silicone lid.",
          "If you don’t have time to roll out all the dough into wrappers, you can refrigerate the dough overnight. However, it is very difficult to roll out the dough when it is still cold. Let the dough sit on the counter and reach room temperature before rolling it out."

          "Let the starter sit 1 to 12 hours: Cover the starter and place it out of the way for at least 1 or up to 12 hours. The starter will become increasingly bubbly the longer it sits and will double in bulk. The longer you can let the starter ferment, the better the flavor and structure of your finished English muffins.",
          "Whisk together the milk, yeast, and starter: In the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl, combine the milk and yeast for the dough. Scrape the starter into the bowl and use a whisk to break it up and dissolve it into the milk. It should become quite frothy.",
          "Mix the dough together: Add the sugar, butter, and salt to the bowl and whisk to combine. Add 3 cups of the flour and stir with a stiff spatula until you form a shaggy, floury dough.",
          "Knead the dough: With a dough hook on a stand mixer, knead the dough until it comes together in a smooth ball, 5 to 8 minutes. Alternatively, knead by hand against the counter. If the dough is very sticky like bubble gum, add extra flour as needed, but err on the side of caution. The dough is ready when it forms into a smooth ball and springs back when poked; it will feel slightly tacky to the touch, but shouldn’t stick to the bowl or your hands.",
          "Let the dough rise overnight in the fridge: Transfer the dough to a large bowl lightly filmed with oil. Cover and place in the fridge overnight or for up to 3 days.",
          "Divide and shape the muffins: Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Use a pastry scraper to divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece gently against the counter to shape into smooth, round balls.",
          "Transfer the muffins to a baking sheet to rise: Scatter cornmeal generously over a baking sheet and arrange the balls on top, spaced a little apart. If you have muffin rings, place them around the balls at this point. Sprinkle the tops of the balls with more cornmeal.",
          "Let the muffins rise until puffy: For dough that was refrigerated, this will take 1 1/2 to 2 hours; for room temperature dough, this will take about 1 hour. Depending on the size of your muffin rings, the muffins may not totally fill the rings — that’s okay.",
          "Warm a skillet: When ready to cook the muffins, warm a large skillet over medium heat. Melt a small pat of butter — enough to just coat the bottom of the pan and prevent sticking.",
          "Cook the muffins 5 to 6 minutes on one side: Working in batches, transfer a few of the muffins to the skillet — allow an inch or so of space between muffins and do not crowd the pan. If using rings, transfer the muffins with their rings to the pan. Cook until the bottoms of the muffins are golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.",
          "Flip and cook 5 to 6 minutes on the other side: Flip the muffins and cook the other side until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. If you prefer thinner, less puffy English muffins, you can gently press the tops with the spatula to prevent them from rising too much.",
          "Adjust the heat as needed: If your muffins seem to be browning too quickly on the bottoms (or not quickly enough), adjust the heat as needed. (If you find that your muffins are browning too quickly, throw them in the oven at 350°F to finish baking through.)",
          "Finish cooking all of the muffins: Transfer cooked muffins to a cooling rack. Continue working in batches until all the muffins have been cooked. Add a small pat of butter to the pan between batches to prevent sticking.",
          "Split and serve! Split the English muffins with a fork, spread with butter or jam (or both!), and eat. English muffins will keep for several days in an airtight container on the counter and are fantastic warmed in the toaster oven. Fresh English muffins can also be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and kept frozen for up to 3 months."

    "backstory": "<p>In 1955, Ernest Morgado, a Honolulu businessman, served a group of farmers grilled chicken that had been marinated in his mother’s teriyaki-style sauce. It was such a hit that he decided to market it with the name “huli huli.” Huli means “turn” in Hawaiian and refers to how it’s prepared: grilled between two racks and turned halfway through cooking. This simplified version calls for chicken pieces and a standard grill. The original recipe is a trade secret, but you can find many slightly different variations on the internet, typically including ginger, garlic, soy sauce, something sweet (honey, brown sugar or maple syrup) and something acidic (vinegar, white wine, lime juice or pineapple juice). This recipe is adapted from “Aloha Kitchen: Recipes from Hawai‘i” by Alana Kysar (Ten Speed, March 2019). It also works beautifully with boneless chicken thighs, but adjust your cooking time accordingly.</p>",

Add the water and bring to a boil. Cook, skimming off any foam and any skins that float to the surface. The chickpeas will need to cook for 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness, sometimes even longer.

    "spicy": "✓",
    "backstory": "<p>This is a wonderful refreshing Indian salad that pairs really well with rich, spicy curries. Made with slices of juicy tomato, scattered with red onion, and drizzled with a mint dressing, then finished with a small pinch of garam masala. The dressing here is simply Raita, thinned down slightly with water so it’s pourable. Raita is a green mint yogurt sauce that is often served on the side of curries. Both yogurt and mint are ideal for cooling the palette in case you can’t handle the heat!</p>",

Breads made with biga develop a wonderful taste due to their long risings which bring out the flavor of the grain. They also remain fresher and taste sweeter than those made with large amounts of commercial yeast.</p>",

    "backstory": "<p>An Iranian barbecue would be incomplete without the dizzying scent of saffron chicken kababs on the grill. Saffron, the primary seasoning, is ground and then steeped in water to draw out its sweet scent, flavor and rich hue. This method is also the most economical use of the precious threads. Nothing goes to waste in this preparation; even the onion from the marinade is cooked to serve as an accompaniment. In this version, grilled peaches are plated alongside the traditional blistered tomatoes for a delightful tangy bite. An overnight marinade will guarantee the juiciest kababs, but don’t worry if you’re short on time; a couple of hours is sufficient. Serve with rice with tahdig and cucumber and herb yogurt, or with bread and herb salad for a light meal.</p>",

These bite-sized burgers were initially called “slyders,” a name that was eventually changed to “sliders.”</p>",

To prevent cross-contamination, one hand sprinkles on the rub and the other hand does the rubbing. Don’t put the hand that is rubbing into the powder."

          "Mix the dough: Combine the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl and mix with your hands until mostly homogenous. Combine the water and vinegar or lemon juice, then add to the bowl. Form one hand into a stiff claw, and stir with it until no dry flour remains and the dough forms a sticky, shaggy ball. Roll the ball around the bowl until most of the dough is part of the same large mass. The mixing process should take no more than 30 to 45 seconds.",
          "Scrape your dough-covered hand with your clean hand or with a metal or plastic dough scraper to get most of the dough into the bowl, then invert a tall-sided medium metal or glass bowl (or a cutting board) and place it on top of the large bowl, tapping it to ensure a tight seal. Let dough rest at least 12 hours and up to 18 hours at room temperature, 60 to 70 degrees. When the dough is done resting, it should appear very bubbly and wet.",
          "Shape the loaf: Wipe out any moisture collected inside the medium bowl. Dust a dish towel thoroughly on one side with rice flour or bread flour, then line the medium bowl with the towel, floured-side up. Generously flour your work surface. Sprinkle flour around the edges of the dough in the large bowl, then tilt the bowl over your floured work surface, using your fingertips to ease the dough away from the bowl until it all tips out. (Some bits of the dough will stick to the bowl, this is OK; leave them behind.)",
          "Working gently but quickly to avoid deflating the dough, using one hand, reach under one side with your fingertips, stretch the dough, and fold it over itself into the center. Repeat three more times until each side of the dough has been folded over the top. Using the sides of your hands instead of your fingertips and as much extra flour as necessary to prevent sticking, flip the dough over. With your palms up and hands placed flat on the work surface, gently tuck the dough together underneath until the top surface is relatively smooth and taut.",
          "Proof the loaf: Carefully lift the dough, place it smooth-side up into the towel-lined bowl, and dust lightly with rice flour or bread flour. Cover the bowl with a large baking sheet and allow the dough ball to rise until it roughly doubles in volume and doesn’t spring back readily when you poke it with a fingertip, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, wash out the large bowl and have it ready.",
          "Heat the oven: At least 30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees. When dough is ready, invert the bowl and baking sheet so that the dough is lying on the sheet. (The sheet will end up inverted.) Lift off the bowl and carefully lift off the kitchen towel. If it sticks at all, be very gentle when coaxing the dough off; the goal is to minimize the loss of gases trapped inside.",
          "Bake the bread: Splash some water inside the larger metal bowl, then invert it onto the baking sheet over the dough. Transfer the whole thing to the oven, reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees, and bake for 25 minutes. Using oven mitts or dry kitchen towels, remove the bowl and continue baking until the loaf is as dark as you’d like it, 15 to 25 minutes longer. Remove the bread, transfer to a cooling rack, and allow to cool completely before cutting it open."

Flip the patties, and top each with a large pile of sliced onions — as many as you can balance on top; they should resemble a large haystack.

Holding the spatula upside down (so that the head of the spatula is angled down to increase leverage), scrape the edges of each patty off the pan, working around each patty to ensure that you don’t leave any crispy edges behind. When the edges have all been loosened, turn the spatula back over (so you are holding it the standard way) and flip the patties onion side down. Use the spatula and tongs or a fork to tuck any stray onion slices mostly under the patties.",

Baking takes a bit of practice because the oven must be heated to reach a very high temperature before the dough is inserted. The last few breads will bake a bit faster than the first few because the baking sheet will be hot.</p>",

          "In a saucepan, bring the broth to a boil; reduce the heat to a simmer and cover. Add the saffron and the smoked paprika to the broth. Taste; the broth should be well seasoned, so add more salt if necessary. Remove from the heat until ready to add to the rice.",
          "Add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken skin-side down and the head of garlic; sauté until the chicken is golden. The oil may splatter, so be careful. Transfer the partially cooked chicken to a platter. Leave the head of garlic in the pan.",
          "Reduce the heat to medium low. Slowly sauté the artichokes and green beans in the same pan, until the artichokes are golden and tender, and the beans are soft and slightly wrinkled, 10 minutes. When the artichokes and green beans are done, push them to the perimeter of the pan where there’s less heat (or transfer them to the platter with the chicken.)",

          "If there’s more than 1 tablespoon of oil in the pan, pour out the excess.",
          "Increase the heat to medium and sauté the grated onion and sliced garlic until the onion is soft (it’s all right if it gets slightly brown), about 5 minutes. Add the grated tomato. Season well with salt and sauté until the water from the tomato has cooked out and the mixture, called a sofrito, has darkened to a burgundy color and is a very thick purée, 5 to 10 minutes. ",
          "Add the rice, stirring until it’s translucent, 1 to 2 minutes.",
          "Spread out the rice (it should just blanket the bottom of the pan), distribute the green beans and artichokes evenly, and arrange the chicken and sausage in the pan. Increase the heat to medium high and pour in 5 cups of the simmering broth (reserving 1 cup). As the broth comes to a boil, lay the peppers in the pan, starburst-like, and push the head of garlic to the center. Cook until the rice begins to appear above the liquid, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating the pan over one and two burners as necessary to distribute the heat to all areas. Add the sprig of rosemary and reduce the heat to medium low.",
          "When the majority of the stock has been absorbed and small holes appear between the rice, you can lay on additional quicker-cooking items such as shrimp, peas, etc.",
          "Continue to simmer, rotating the pan as necessary, until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is al dente, another 8 to 10 minutes. To check for doneness, taste a grain just below the top layer of rice-there should be a very tiny white dot in the center. If the liquid is absorbed but the rice is not done, add a bit more hot broth or water to the pan and cook a few minutes more.",
          "Cover the pan with foil or cover the grill and cook gently for another 2 minutes, which will help to ensure that the top layer of rice is evenly cooked.",
          "Depending on your heat source, this is tricky. If you can adjust the heat source up, and with the cover/foil still in place, increase the heat to medium high and, turning the pan, cook until the bottom layer of rice starts to caramelize, creating the socarrat, 1 to 2 minutes. You may hear the rice crackling, which is fine, but if it starts burning, remove the pan from the heat immediately. To check for socarrat, peel back the foil and use a spoon to feel for a slight crust on the bottom of the pan. If you are using a charcoal grill, hopefully you had the fire hot enough to start with that it will naturally carry it all the way to the perfect level of doneness. If not, you can use the oven or stove to toast the bottom a little, or just start with a bit more briquettes next time. It will still taste great.",
          "Remove the pan from the heat and let the paella rest, still covered, 10 minutes. Sit everyone down at a round or square table, if possible. Remove the foil, and invite people to eat directly from the pan, starting at the perimeter and working toward the center, squeezing lemon over their section if they like. Serve with alioli and some nice red wine."

          "Paneer – This is a fresh cheese used in Indian cooking. Even though nowadays you can buy it at stores, homemade is superior by a long shot. It’s softer, with a much more creamy texture (store-bought is hard and dry). It’s easy to make, it’s just milk curdled with an acid, then strained.",
          "Ghee is clarified butter, one of the traditional fats used in Indian cooking. It is simply butter without the water and milk solids, so you have pure butter fat. It has a more intense flavour than butter. Either buy it, make it (it’s easy and keeps for months) or just use normal butter!",
          "Fenugreek seeds – Available at stores that carry a decent range of spices. I found it at Harris Farms (Australia). Also, of course, at Indian grocery stores! They are used whole in this recipe. Don’t worry they soften through cooking so you will not bite down on one and break a tooth!",
          "How to peel tomatoes (easily) – Cut a cross in the base of the tomato and cut out a small circle from the stem end. Bring a saucepan of water to the boil, then put tomatoes in for 30 seconds. The skin will start curl away from the cut. Remove, put in bowl of cold water (just from the tap is fine). Then the skin will easily peel off. Scoop out watery seeds, then finely chop and use per recipe. If you are in a hurry, you can use 3/4 cup of canned crushed tomato instead.",
          "Green chilli – Use a large green chilli (cayenne) so it’s not too spicy.",
          "Spinach – This recipe is best made using bunches of fresh true spinach, known as English Spinach. You will need ~5 large bunches weighing 1.25 kg in total in order to get ~700g/1.4lb of spinach leaves. Yes, that is a lot – but think of all the nutrition you’re getting in! Pick off the leaves, weigh out 700g/1.4lb. If it’s easier to use baby spinach, add some texture back in by using half baby spinach and half kale.",
          "Pan-fried paneer – While you are welcome to use paneer that has not been pan-fried, you’ll find that raw paneer is a bit delicate and prone to crumbling when stirred into curries. Once pan-fried, it sets better so it’s not as delicate. Plus, that golden crust is so good!",
          "Storage – This curry will keep for 4 to 5 days in the fridge, but the spice flavour does start to fade. It’s best consumed freshly made, or the next day."

          "Once the milk has reached the correct temperature, continue to hold the milk at this temperature for about 20-30 minutes. This will prepare the milk proteins to respond well to the acid addition in the next step.",
          "Allow the milk to cool to 170F. This is a more protein friendly temperature and allows the acid to easily mix into the milk before the proteins begin to coagulate. The result will be a more even curd development.",

          "Once cooled to 170F, slowly add the diluted citric acid to the milk while gently stirring. This will begin separating the milk solids from liquid. Continue the slow stir until you see a separation of white curd and a yellow green whey, milk with a high fat content may have a cloudy whey.",
          "When you see a nice separation, stop stirring. The pot can now sit quiet for 20 minutes.",
          "The curds can now be transferred to the colander lined with butter muslin. Begin by ladling the whey from the surface into the lined colander. Once the whey has been partially removed, the remaining curd can be poured into the drain cloth.",
          "Drain curd for 30 minutes, a gentle stir half way through will help the whey to drain.",
          "Once the curd has drained for 30 minutes, the cloth can be pulled up and tied into a ball. Make sure the cloth is pulled tightly around the curd mass. Then place a plate or lid over the curd. Place about 1-2 gallons of warm water into a pot and set it on top of the plate, this is a quick and easy “cheese press.” Press the curd for 10 to 15 minutes. The amount of weight and time for pressing will depend on how dry and compact you want your final Paneer to be."

          "To make pizza now: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise till it’s very puffy. This will take about an hour using instant yeast, or 90 minutes using active dry. If it takes longer, that’s OK; just give it some extra time.",
          "To make pizza later: Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate the dough for 4 hours (or for up to 24 hours); it will rise slowly as it chills.

You’ll probably get about two-thirds of the way there before the dough starts shrinking back; walk away for 15 minutes. Cover the dough while you’re away, so it doesn’t dry out.",
          "When you come back, you should be able to pat the dough closer to the corners of the pan. Repeat the rest and dough-stretch one more time, if necessary; your goal is to get the dough to fill the pan as fully as possible.",
          "Allow the dough to rise, covered, till it’s noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes (if it hasn’t been refrigerated); or 2 to 2 1/2 hours (if it’s been refrigerated). Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.",
          "Bake the pizza on the lower oven rack till it looks and feels set on top, and is just beginning to brown around the edge of the crust, but is still pale on top. This will take about 8 minutes for thinner crust pizza; about 10 to 12 minutes for medium thickness; and 12 to 14 minutes for thick-crust pizza. If you’re baking two pizzas, reverse them in the oven (top to bottom, bottom to top) midway through the baking period.",
          "To serve pizza immediately: Remove it from the oven, and arrange your toppings of choice on top. Return to the oven, and bake on the upper oven rack for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned, both top and bottom, and the cheese is melted. Check it midway through, and move it to the bottom rack if the top is browning too much, or the bottom not enough.",

When ready to serve, top and bake in a preheated 450°F oven, adding a couple of minutes to the baking times noted above. Your goal is a pizza whose crust is browned, and whose toppings are hot/melted.",

Because the mixture is completely unleavened (no baking powder, yeast or even eggs), they run the risk of turning dense and gummy if you overwork the batter. This is good news for the lazy: The less work you put in, the better they come out. They can be made with virtually any meat or vegetable odds and ends, but they’re especially great with that crunchy sauerkraut languishing in the back of your fridge from that cookout you had last year.</p>",

The first restaurant opened in Taipei in 1980, and at one point was included on the New York Times list of the top ten restaurants in the world. They expanded to the US in 2000, setting up shop in Arcadia, CA, and due to their popularity – the wait to get seated is frequently more than an hour – have since opened three more locations in Southern California. But the competition for soupy dumplings is intense in the San Gabriel Valley, and what keeps Din Tai Fung at the top of many people’s list are some of the other items on their menu. For me, that item is the green beans with garlic. The trick to achieving the blistered skin is to flash-fry the green beans before sautéing them.</p>",

The dough is then allowed to rise until it is even with the top of the pan. The risen dough is then carefully placed in a 535 F oven to par-bake for about 7 to 8 minutes until it just starts to show some color and interior has fully set. The par-baked pizza is then cooled completely on a cooling rack for several hours and wrapped for refrigeration or even freezing. The cool down and refrigeration process is the true secret of getting a surprisingly light crust."

Fresher is better, so be sure to use it as soon as possible, or keep sealed air-tight in the refrigerator for a few days at most.

But then we heard about Jeff Hertzberg, a physician from Minneapolis, who devised a streamlined technique for a crusty loaf of bread. Mix flour, salt, yeast and water. Let it sit a bit, refrigerate it, take some out and let it rise, then bake it. The crusty, full-flavored loaf that results may be the world’s easiest yeast bread. —Nick Fox</p>",

          "Combine bread flour, tapioca flour, dry yeast and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk to evenly mix together. Add the water and stir with a wooden spoon until a lumpy dough forms. Do not over-stir. It is OK that the dough is unevenly mixed at this point. Then add the salt and olive oil, and stir to combine again.",
          "The dough should be fairly sticky at this point. If not (like in the winter when it’s cold and dry), add 1 tbsp more of water. Scrape the dough onto a working surface. DO NOT KNEAD IT. Lift one side of the dough up and fold it over itself like folding paper. Turn it 90 degrees and fold again. Cover it with plastic wrap to rest for 15 min, then repeat. Let rest for 15 min again, then repeat folding. Do this 3~4 times until the dough is springy and not lumpy.",
          "Place the dough in a large bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let it proof in the fridge for 24 hours.",
          "1 hour before baking, take the dough out of the fridge. Scrape it carefully onto a well dusted working surface without flattening the air bubbles inside. Fold the dough once or twice, then cut the dough into 2 equal parts (or leave it whole if you have an oven big enough for a huge pie). Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest and come back completely to room temperature, approx 1 hour.",
          "30 min before baking, place a large flat cast-iron pan/pizza stone in the oven on the middle rack and preheat it to 500ºF/230ºC. I suspect most people out there don’t have a pizza stone sitting around which includes me. I just use a round SHALLOW cast-iron pan and it works BEAUTIFULLY.",
          "Once the oven is preheated, you can start preparing the dough.",
          "Take 1 piece of dough and dust it well with semolina flour. Start pressing the dough down GENTLY WITHOUT breaking or tearing it. Unless you have giant, fat, sausage-like fingers with virtually no nails (which punctures the dough), I’d suggest holding your hands into a fist and use your knuckles to press the dough down. Start with gently pressing around the edges of the dough, then work from the center outward towards the edge. The intention is as much about shaping the dough as re-distributing the air bubbles throughout. Flip the dough over and repeat. Don’t work it too much. At any given moment if the dough is getting resistant and springing back to its previous shape, DO NOT FORCE IT. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 min then come back to it. This will take practice and you will never be able to get the dough to be as thin as most pizzas, and that’s OK. We are not aiming for thin-crust. You should have small, loose air bubbles throughout the dough when you are done.",
          "Once you are happy with the shape of the dough, hold out your forearm over the dough then flip the dough onto your forearm so it “hangs”, and lift the dough up that way. Gently shake your arm to release excess flour on the dough and place the dough lightly down onto a sheet of parchment paper (or a pizza pan). Drizzle approx 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil evenly on top and dust with sea salt (I shaved a little parmigiano on top but you don’t have to). Then lift the parchment paper to transfer the dough into the cast-iron pan/pizza stone.",
          "Bake in the oven for 10 min or until puffed and golden brown. If you are using a rectangular pizza pan, place the pan onto the bottom of the oven for 15 min until a bottom crust forms (preferably using bottom heat), then move it to middle rack until it’s golden brown on the top (preferably using top heat). You can prepare the other half of the dough during this time.",
          "Then you are only limited by your imagination to what goes on top. Today it’s as simple as whole-milk ricotta, baby arugula and shaved parmigiano cheese with a few drops of balsamic vinegar."

          "Place the flour/starch combination (either option 1 or 2), instant yeast, sugar, salt, and oil in a mixing bowl. If you are using a stand mixer, use a dough hook attachment. Add cold milk or room temperature water. Start with 150 ml and add more until you can form a dough. You will most likely need to add more milk/water. I would rather you start with the lowest amount of liquid and add more teaspoon by teaspoon until the dough comes together. With option 1 I use close to 200 ml and with option 2 I need about 180 ml. This is just for your reference, you may need more or less.",
          "Continue to knead at low speed (speed 2 on KA) for 12-15 minutes (updated for the best result) or until the dough is smooth, silky and elastic.",
          "Rest the dough for 15 minutes. This is not to proof the dough. It shouldn’t double in size. This is to relax the gluten for easier shaping and rolling the dough, then proceed to next step that’s applicable to you.",
          "If you are going to make steamed buns with filling, divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Lightly dust the work surface with some flour. Work with one dough at a time. Knead the dough a few times to push out any air bubbles (if any). Flatten the dough with your palm and then use a rolling pin to roll it out to form a circle about 4-5 inches, with a slightly thicker middle part. This is to support the weight of the filling. Don’t roll the dough too thin. If you roll the dough too thin, the filling might make the steamed buns “wrinkle” later when you steam. Place the filling at the center and then gather the sides to enclose the bun and pinch to seal. Flip the bun so the seam side is down now.",
          "Cup the dough with both palms and move the dough in a circular motion to shape it taller. This part is important so your steamed buns come out tall instead of spreading to the side after steaming. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and proceed to proofing.",
          "If you are just making plain steamed buns with no filling (round shape), divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Lightly dust the work surface with some flour. Work with one dough at a time. Knead the dough a few times to push out any air bubbles (if any).",
          "Then pull and tuck the dough so the seams are at the bottom and the surface is smooth and round. Roll the dough into a smooth round ball in between the palm of your hand or as I did in the video. REALLY make sure the dough is smooth.",
          "Cup the dough with both palms and move the dough in a circular motion to shape it taller. This part is important so your steamed buns come out tall instead of spreading to the side after steaming.",
          "Place on a piece of parchment paper. Lightly dab the surface of the bun with some milk using your finger to smooth the surface. Loosely cover with clean kitchen towel to prevent drying. Work with another dough and do the same. Proceed to proofing after that.",
          "For mantou shape, roll the dough into a long log and use a dough cutter to cut into 8 equal portions using serrated knife is best so it won’t squish the dough down. Lightly dab the surface of the bun with some milk using your finger to smooth the surface. Proceed to proofing step below.",
          "Proofing: Let the dough rise at room temperature or at a warm place. If it’s winter where you are, you can use your oven “bread proof” function to let them proof in there, or simply turn on your oven to the lowest temperature and then turn off and after 15 minutes, place the shaped buns in there to let them proof. They won’t necessarily double in size, but at least puff up to about 50% of the original size. This may take about 1 hour or longer at a warm temperature. Don’t go by the time however.",
          "Steaming: Most likely your steamer won’t be able to accommodate steaming all buns at one go, unless you have something like this 3-tier food steamer (which I really love). You may need to steam in 2-3 batches, which means, the rest of the batches will sit longer and continue to proof while waiting for the steamer. Here’s what you can do: Make sure to cover them with plastic wrap and then place them in the refrigerator to slow down the yeast activity until they are ready to be steamed.",
          "Please note that I use the largest burner on my stove. Different sizes of burners will produce different amount of heat, so use your largest burner. Bring the water in your steamer to a boil. Wrap the lid of your steamer with a kitchen towel to prevent moisture dripping back on the steamed buns as this will create “burn” spots.",
          "LOWER THE HEAT TO MEDIUM. Place the buns in there, leaving about 1-inch space in between. Cover with a lid but leaving it about 1/4-inch gap for some steam to escape. Steam on medium heat for 8-10 minutes for plain medium-large buns with no filling, 15 minutes for large buns with raw meat filling. This is especially important if you see that you have overproof the steamed buns (the steamed buns have doubled in size and they have widened to the side). As long as you steam them like this, the buns will not wrinkle and collapse later when you take them out from the steamer.",
          "After steaming, turn off the heat. DO NOT OPEN THE LID of the steamer. Let the buns sit there for 1 minute. The buns will not sink or wrinkle due to the sudden change in temperature.",
          "Proceed with the next batch and steam with the same method and setting as I mentioned above. You don’t have to wait for the water in the steamer to cool down to start. Just turn on the stove, crack the lid open and the time starts when water is back to a simmer again.",
          "Cooling: Immediately remove the buns to wire rack to let them cool down. This is to ensure the bottom of the steamed buns will not be wet and soggy.",
          "Storing: If you make extra and plan to store them, let the already steamed buns cooled down completely and then place them on a baking sheet, not touching each other, and then put the entire tray inside the freezer for about 1 hour. They will harden, but not completely frozen yet. Transfer to a freezer bag and they will not stick to each other anymore. Try not to keep for more than 1 month.",
          "Reheating: They can go straight from freezer to steamer when you ready to eat them. Steam on high heat for 5 minutes and they are as good as new."

When two proteins in flour come into contact with water, gluten forms a network inside the dough, trapping the gas produced by the yeast. To build lots of gluten from the get-go, bakers employ a technique known as autolyse, in which flour and water are mixed and left to rest, usually before adding the starter. During autolyse, gluten bonds form that create the basic structure of the dough. As little as 30 minutes of autolyse can be effective, but generally speaking a couple of hours is optimal. It will give your gluten a head start and decrease the amount of mixing down the line.",

Weigh out 750 grams of lukewarm tap water (about 90 degrees) and add to the flours. Mix gently with a clean hand or a flexible bench scraper until all the flours are hydrated and no dry spots remain. Cover with a damp dish towel, and let sit at least 30 minutes while you wait until your starter is ready (see Step 2).",
          "Make sure the starter is ready to use (perform a float test). When the sudsy bubbles on the surface of a starter form a dome and it appears on the verge of collapse, drop about a teaspoon of starter into a small bowl of room temperature water. If it floats, the starter is full of gas and ready to use (ripe). If it sinks, let it sit, checking every 30 minutes, until you see even more activity and then try the test again.",
          "Combine the autolyse and starter. Add 200 grams of ripe starter to the bowl with the flour-water mixture. Pinching with your thumb, forefinger and middle finger on one hand and rotating the bowl with the other, mix until the starter is completely incorporated.",
          "Assess texture and add salt. At this point, the dough should be wet but also extremely extensible (having the ability to stretch without snapping back). Sprinkle 20 grams salt and 20 grams of water across the dough, and pinch, as before, to incorporate. Cover with a damp towel and let sit for 10 minutes.",
          "Mix the dough. Uncover the dough. Slide a wet hand down along the inside of the bowl and underneath the dough. Grasp a handful and stretch it upward until you feel resistance, then fold it back onto the dough mass. Repeat this motion continuously for 10 minutes, rotating the bowl about 90 degrees each time. As you work the dough, it will progress from very slack and sticky to smoother and more elastic.",
          "Check if the dough has built enough gluten (perform the windowpane test). After 10 minutes of mixing, pinch off a golf ball-size piece of dough and gently stretch it with your fingertips, working it both longer and wider until you have a thin, even membrane through which light can pass. If the dough tears before this point, continue to mix and check again every 10 minutes. (If you’re mixing for more than 20 minutes and the dough is not yet at this point, feel free to move on. Your bread will still turn out.) Use a flexible bench scraper to scrape dough out onto a clean surface. Rinse the bowl to remove any dried flour, then return the dough to the damp bowl.",
          "Prepare for the dough’s first rise (bulk fermentation). Mark where the dough hits the side of the bowl with a piece of tape. Note the time, and the temperature of the dough. It should be 76 degrees to 80 degrees. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let sit for 60 minutes.",
          "Fold the dough. Using a wet hand and the same mixing motion as Step 5, but with a gentler touch to avoid knocking out any gas, perform four folds, making a full rotation of the bowl. Cover the bowl, wait 1 hour, then perform the same series of four folds. Cover and repeat every 60 minutes, until the dough feels pillowy and filled with air, which can take at least 3 hours and as many as 7. Each time you fold the dough, it should feel lighter and sit higher in the bowl.",
          "Shape dough for the first time (pre-shaping). Clear and lightly flour a work surface. Gently turn out the dough, letting its weight coax it out of the bowl and loosening the sides with the bench scraper. Divide the dough in half with the bench scraper. Using floured hands and working with one piece of dough at a time, gently pull all the edges of the dough toward the center to create a round, tidy packet. (The non-floured surface will readily stick to itself.) Use a bench scraper to turn the loose ball of dough over so it rests seam-side down. Cover with a clean towel and repeat with the second half of dough. Let both pieces of dough rest, covered, on the work surface for 20 minutes.",
          "Prepare the shaping baskets. As dough rests, line two baskets or mixing bowls with clean kitchen towels. Stir together a 50/50 mixture of white bread flour and rice flour. (Rice flour will prevent sticking.) Dust the interiors of the baskets generously with the 50/50 flour mixture. Set aside.",
          "Shape the dough a last time (final shaping). Uncover one piece of dough and lightly dust the top with the 50/50 flour mixture. In one decisive motion, use the bench scraper to lift and turn the dough over floured-side down. Slide your fingertips beneath the dough and stretch it gently into a square shape.",
          "Fold the left side of the dough inward toward the center, then fold the right side inward and overtop of the left fold. Starting at the end closest to you, roll the dough away from you into a bulky spiral. Let the dough sit for a minute or two on its seam to help it seal, then use a bench scraper to lift up the dough and place it seam-side up in one of the prepared baskets. Lightly dust the exposed part of the dough with more of the 50/50 flour mixture, and cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the second piece of dough.",
          "Let the shaped dough rise inside the baskets (proofing). Rest loaves at room temperature, checking on them periodically, until the surface of the dough has settled and the entire loaves have slightly increased in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.",
          "Check if dough is proofed (the poke test). Press a floured finger about 1/2 inch into the dough. If the dough springs back immediately, it needs more time — check again every 20 minutes. But, if it springs back slowly and a slight impression remains, the dough is proofed.",
          "Chill the dough. Once the dough passes the poke test, cover the baskets with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator. Chill overnight and up to two days before baking. The longer the dough spends in the refrigerator, the tangier the final bread will taste."

Cover and return it to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Then, carefully remove the lid and reduce the oven temperature to 450 degrees. Continue to bake the loaf uncovered until the surface is deeply browned all over, another 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven, and use tongs to help you pull out the loaf. Transfer the Dutch oven back to the oven, and set the oven temperature back to 500 degrees. Repeat the process with the second loaf of bread.",
          "Cut and serve! Allow the loaves to cool completely, for a few hours, before cutting into them. Whole loaves can be stored uncovered at room temperature for 1 day. Once cut, bread should be stored in paper bags at room temperature and will keep for 5 days or longer. After the second day, it benefits from light toasting."

Perhaps you’ve seen them on social media — sourdough loaves with burnished, intricately scored crusts and expansive, holey interiors — and wondered if you too could make this kind of bread. The answer is yes, you absolutely can. The method below will walk you through all the key steps and core concepts a first-time sourdough baker needs to bake naturally leavened bread at home with good, even great, results. You’ll need to invest in some essential equipment, find a starter, and set aside three days (though only the second requires serious tending — you can start on Friday to have loaves on Sunday). But for those dedicated to learning an age- old craft, it’s the start of a deeply rewarding journey. Your first loaves won’t be perfect, and that’s fine. Any sourdough bread made by your hand will still be delicious.</p>",

No one else in the family joined us; they eschewed the burden of my father’s lousy temper and his drinking, and the mallets and picks it took to eat his favorite meal. The room smelled of Michelob and Old Bay seasoning. The crabs’ shells were spicy and sharp. Cracking, sucking, sometimes drawing blood, I’d work my way to the moist, sweet meat. To this day, I crave a crab boil in summer, with all of its pleasures and its pain. — Betsy Andrews</p>",

Transfer the stromboli to the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Pinch the ends tightly to seal and tuck underneath the stromboli. Loosely cover the stromboli with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour. (The stromboli won’t look much different after the rise; that’s okay.)",

          "Probably the first thing you want to do (if you’re using charcoal, which I would recommend), is to get the charcoal going first, so it’s ready when the fish is prepared.",
          "Make sure you rinse your fish with water and then pat them dry with a paper towel.",
          "Take your lemongrass stalks and beat and bruise them with something hard, like a mortar, or a rolling pin or something like that. This is going to bring out the lovely flavor of the lemongrass. Also prepare a small handful of kaffir lime leaves.",
          "Fold the lemongrass in half and begin to stuff the fish with a stalk of lemongrass and about 10 kaffir lime leaves. Depending on how big your fish is will determine how many stalks of lemongrass you can fit. I put 2 - 3 lemongrass stalks in each fish in the video. Make sure it’s tight, but also make sure not to push so hard that you break the flesh of the fish.",
          "In a large mixing bowl or pan add ½ kilo bag of salt, sprinkle in 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour, and add about 1 tablespoon of water. Mix it up thoroughly, massaging the mixture with your hand, until it’s fully mixed. You want the salt to be a little moist so it sticks to the fish easily.",
          "Add the fish to the pan and start plastering it with the salt mixture. Pat and rub the fish with the salt, making sure to cover the entire fish, and all over the head and tail. Do the same to both fish.",
          "For grilling the fish, you want to have a steady, yet quite low heat. Make sure you have a bed of coals, and if they are too hot you can either tone them down with a scoop of ashes, or push the really hot coals to one side of the grill and put the fish on the other side (using a little indirect heat). You can also add more coals as you keep on cooking. You want to slow cook the fish without them burning on the outside. My fish took almost 1 hour to grill. So aim for low heat for slow cooking.",
          "Once your fish is on the grill, it’s time to get started on the seafood sauce (below).",
          "Try to wait for about 15 minutes before you flip the fish. If you flip it too early, when the salt hasn’t dried out completely yet, the fish skin might get stuck onto the griddle. Flip the fish as little as possible.",
          "Keep roasting until the fish feels firm and the white salted skin has turned crusty and golden. It should take about 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
          "Take the fish off the grill, and set it on a platter.",
          "To eat the fish, you can either use a knife or scissors, and from the top of the fish, cut through the skin. The skin should cleanly lift off the fish revealing moist and beautiful meat.",

    "backstory": "<p>The word “ravioli” is derived from the Italian verb “riavvolgere,” which means “to wrap” or “to roll up.” This is fitting because ravioli is made by enclosing a filling, usually made of cheese, meat, vegetables, or a combination of ingredients, between two layers of thin pasta dough. The dough is then sealed together to form small, square or circular parcels.</p>",

Make sure all the fish is covered with flour, including the cuts to ensure a crispy crust. The drier the fish is the more even fry it will produce. Shake off any excess flour, then stand the fish up on its belly pulling the belly flaps outward. If the fish falls over, make a longer cut from the belly to create a wider base and help the fish stand up easily in the wok.",

The temperature of the oil will drop once the fish in in so increase the heat to medium-high to bring it back up to a sizzle. Shallow fry the fish until deep golden brown and very crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. As it cooks, ladle hot oil over any exposed part of the fish to ensure even cooking.

          "Typical ingredients for making yakiniku sauce include soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sesame seeds. The addition of sesame oil and garlic adds more complexity and boldness to the sauce. The key to yakiniku sauce, however, is sesame seeds, and in this recipe, the addition of roasted, ground sesame seeds takes the sauce to an entirely new level of “wow.” The ground roasted sesame seeds impart a complexity of flavors that makes the sauce mouth-wateringly delicious."

    "title": "Yakiniku Sauce for Grilled Japanese Meat",
    "backstory": "<p>Yakiniku sauce is a term derived from the Japanese term <em>yaki</em> , which means “grilled,” and <em>niku</em> , which means “meat,” or “beef.” It is used broadly to describe various grilled and cooked meats, including American outdoor BBQ style meats and Korean style BBQ. Regardless of the cooking method, grilled meat is often served with a yakiniku dipping sauce, or it is seasoned with yakiniku sauce prior to being cooked.</p>",
