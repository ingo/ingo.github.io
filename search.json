Combine the garlic, peppercorns, ginger, and lemongrass in a mortar and lightly pound to bruise and slightly crush them. Add them along with the cilantro and green onions to the brine, then add the birds breast side down. If they float, weigh them down with a plate.

Tuck each wing tip under the body. Put the birds in the fridge, uncovered, to dry out for at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours.","Marinate the birds: Stir the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and pepper in a small bowl along with the 2 tablespoons of water until the sugar is fully dissolved. Brush the birds with the marinade, then put them back, uncovered, into the fridge for about 2 hours.","Cook the birds on the grill (highly recommended): Prepare a charcoal grill to cook at 350°F to 375°F. If your grill doesn’t have a firebox, which allows for easy indirect cooking, push the coals to one side of the grill and form them into a mound. Add the birds, breasts up, to the grill rack opposite the charcoal, and cover the grill, opening the vents and rotating the grill cover if possible so the vents are directly over the birds. Positioning the open vents above the birds will pull the charcoal smoke toward them, giving them a little more smoky flavor. While you cook, you’ll have to add more charcoal as necessary to maintain the temperature.","Cook for 25 minutes, flip the birds over to get some color on the other side, and after about 5 minutes more, flip the birds over again.","If you’re not cooking on a grill with a firebox, carefully remove the birds and the grill grate.

After 5 minutes more, brush the birds all over with the honey mixture and move them so they’re directly over the coals. Keep cooking, covered, turning over and rotating the birds as necessary to achieve even browning and brushing occasionally with the honey mixture, until the skin is a slightly glossy golden brown with some dark patches and the juices of the thigh run clear, 5 to 10 minutes more, depending on the size of the bird.","In the oven: Move the oven rack to the bottom third of the oven, and preheat the oven to 350°F. Put the birds breast side up on a baking tray (or even better, a rack set over a tray or roasting pan).","Roast the birds for 30 minutes.

If your fire died, relight the briquettes.","Bring the broth back to a simmer if it has cooled down.","If there’s more than 1 tablespoon of oil in the pan, pour out the excess.","Increase the heat to medium and sauté the grated onion and sliced garlic until the onion is soft (it’s all right if it gets slightly brown), about 5 minutes. Add the grated tomato. Season well with salt and sauté until the water from the tomato has cooked out and the mixture, called a sofrito, has darkened to a burgundy color and is a very thick purée, 5 to 10 minutes.","Add the rice, stirring until it’s translucent, 1 to 2 minutes.","Spread out the rice (it should just blanket the bottom of the pan), distribute the green beans and artichokes evenly, and arrange the chicken and sausage in the pan.

If you can adjust the heat source up, and with the cover/foil still in place, increase the heat to medium high and, turning the pan, cook until the bottom layer of rice starts to caramelize, creating the socarrat, 1 to 2 minutes.

Slowly sauté the artichokes and green beans in the same pan, until the artichokes are golden and tender, and the beans are soft and slightly wrinkled, 10 minutes. When the artichokes and green beans are done, push them to the perimeter of the pan where there’s less heat (or transfer them to the platter with the chicken.)","If you like, you can pause here for a bit and wait until you are about 40 minutes out from dinner before proceeding.","When ready to proceed, add the remaining ~40-50 briquettes (2.5 lbs.). If your fire died, relight the briquettes.","Bring the broth back to a simmer if it has cooled down.","If there’s more than 1 tablespoon of oil in the pan, pour out the excess.","Increase the heat to medium and sauté the grated onion and sliced garlic until the onion is soft (it’s all right if it gets slightly brown), about 5 minutes. Add the grated tomato. Season well with salt and sauté until the water from the tomato has cooked out and the mixture, called a sofrito, has darkened to a burgundy color and is a very thick purée, 5 to 10 minutes. ","Add the rice, stirring until it’s translucent, 1 to 2 minutes.","Spread out the rice (it should just blanket the bottom of the pan), distribute the green beans and artichokes evenly, and arrange the chicken and sausage in the pan. Increase the heat to medium high and pour in 5 cups of the simmering broth (reserving 1 cup). As the broth comes to a boil, lay the peppers in the pan, starburst-like, and push the head of garlic to the center. Cook until the rice begins to appear above the liquid, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating the pan over one and two burners as necessary to distribute the heat to all areas. Add the sprig of rosemary and reduce the heat to medium low.","When the majority of the stock has been absorbed and small holes appear between the rice, you can lay on additional quicker-cooking items such as shrimp, peas, etc.","Continue to simmer, rotating the pan as necessary, until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is al dente, another 8 to 10 minutes. To check for doneness, taste a grain just below the top layer of rice-there should be a very tiny white dot in the center. If the liquid is absorbed but the rice is not done, add a bit more hot broth or water to the pan and cook a few minutes more.","Cover the pan with foil or cover the grill and cook gently for another 2 minutes, which will help to ensure that the top layer of rice is evenly cooked.","Depending on your heat source, this is tricky. If you can adjust the heat source up, and with the cover/foil still in place, increase the heat to medium high and, turning the pan, cook until the bottom layer of rice starts to caramelize, creating the socarrat, 1 to 2 minutes. You may hear the rice crackling, which is fine, but if it starts burning, remove the pan from the heat immediately. To check for socarrat, peel back the foil and use a spoon to feel for a slight crust on the bottom of the pan. If you are using a charcoal grill, hopefully you had the fire hot enough to start with that it will naturally carry it all the way to the perfect level of doneness. If not, you can use the oven or stove to toast the bottom a little, or just start with a bit more briquettes next time. It will still taste great.","Remove the pan from the heat and let the paella rest, still covered, 10 minutes. Sit everyone down at a round or square table, if possible. Remove the foil, and invite people to eat directly from the pan, starting at the perimeter and working toward the center, squeezing lemon over their section if they like.

Sift over both sides of the fish with a small hand strainer. Make sure all the fish is covered with flour, including the cuts to ensure a crispy crust. The drier the fish is the more even fry it will produce. Shake off any excess flour, then stand the fish up on its belly pulling the belly flaps outward.

The oil should froth and sizzle. The temperature of the oil will drop once the fish in in so increase the heat to medium-high to bring it back up to a sizzle. Shallow fry the fish until deep golden brown and very crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. As it cooks, ladle hot oil over any exposed part of the fish to ensure even cooking. You will see the cuts you made open up away from the spine and turn golden brown. Once the flesh no longer looks opaque it is done cooking. Remember that the cooking process will continue even after the fish is out of the oil because of the heat trapped in the flesh.","Carefully remove the fish from the oil, Use one hand to grab the tail (if it is too hot use tongs or a towel), lift the tail end of the fish slightly, and slide the spider under the belly.
