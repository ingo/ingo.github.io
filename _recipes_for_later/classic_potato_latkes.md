title: Classic Potato Latkes

### Ingredients

* `4` large russet potatoes (about 2 pounds 8 ounces total), peeled
* `1` small yellow onion (4 to 6 ounces), finely grated
* `2` large eggs, lightly whisked
* `3 tbsp` all-purpose flour
* `1 tbsp` potato starch (may substitute cornstarch)
* `1 tbsp` kosher salt, or more to taste
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola, for frying
* Applesauce, for serving (optional)
* Sour cream or crème fraîche, for serving (optional)
* Lox, for serving (optional)
* Salmon roe, for serving (optional)
* Fresh dill fronds and finely chopped fresh chives, for garnish (optional)

### Directions

1. Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 200 degrees. Place a wire rack inside a large, rimmed baking sheet.
2. Using a food processor fitted with coarse grating attachment, or the large holes of a box grater, grate the potatoes. Transfer to a large piece of folded cheesecloth set in a medium bowl. Twist into a bundle and gently but firmly squeeze out excess liquid into the bowl. (You may need to do this in batches.)
3. Empty the potatoes into a large bowl. Let the liquid sit undisturbed while you prepare the latke mixture.
4. Place a large, heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium heat and warm while you mix the latke mixture. Add the onion, eggs, flour, potato starch, salt and pepper to the potatoes. Gently tilt the bowl with the potato liquid to drain out the water; you should see a white layer of starch at the bottom. Scrape the starch into the bowl with the potatoes and gently mix all the ingredients to combine.
5. Add enough oil to come 1/4 inch up the sides of the skillet and gently swirl the oil around — when the oil gently ripples across the surface, it is hot enough for frying.
6. Working in batches, spoon between 1/4 and 1/3 cup potato mixture per latke into the skillet; you should be able to fit 4 to 5 latkes at a time. Fry the latkes until golden brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes per side, then, using a thin metal spatula, gently flip the latkes. (Your first batch might take up to 4 minutes per side, but as the pan gets hotter, the subsequent batches will go faster. When you see the frilly ends of the latke turn golden brown, it’s time to flip.)
7. Transfer the latkes to the prepared baking sheet; place the sheet in the oven to keep the latkes warm. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture, adding more oil as needed; you may need to adjust the heat with subsequent batches if the latkes start to brown too quickly. As the potato mixture sits, liquid may pool at the bottom of the bowl; be sure to scoop the mixture, draining away any water before adding to the skillet.
8. Transfer the latkes to a large platter and serve warm, with your choice of accompaniments, such as applesauce, sour cream, lox, salmon roe and/or dill and chives, if desired.
