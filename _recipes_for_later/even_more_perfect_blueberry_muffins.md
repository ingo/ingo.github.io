### Directions

1. The directions are not listed in the original text.

### Notes

The recipe has been improved over the years, with inspiration from various sources. It now includes a full teaspoon of coarse sugar on top of each muffin for a crunchy lid, and a generous amount of berries in each muffin. The recipe has been simplified to be a one-bowl recipe, with no sifting, no creaming, and no measuring zest in half-teaspoons. The batter is very thick, allowing for very full cups of batter that grow into perfect bronzed domes in the oven. The recipe makes 9 muffins.
