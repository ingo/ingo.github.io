### Ingredients

* `3 cups` Chicken Broth
* `1.5 cups` Water
* `1.5 cups` finely diced dill pickles
* `1 cup` cubed potatoes (tiny cubes or chunky potatoes, this is up to your personal preference)
* `1/2 cup` Pickle Brine
* Spices as you please - I like a kick so I add cayenne and chili + s&p
* `1 tbsp` butter
* `1 can` coconut milk - I like using this instead of a roux to thicken, but a roux will work too if not better

### Directions

1. Add everything but the butter and coconut milk to a large pot.
2. Let it cook for as long as you'd like, the longer the better.
3. Add the butter and coconut milk towards the end, adjusting to your desired thickness.
