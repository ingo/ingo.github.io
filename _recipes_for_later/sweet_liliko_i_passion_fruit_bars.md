Lilikoi (passion fruit) bars are a very simple and easy dessert to make! The lilikoi’s sweet and tangy taste really brings out it’s flavors in this lovely treat. Along with the sweet custard is a crisp shortbread crust making these bars even more divine.

### Ingredients

* `3 cups` flour (divided)
* `2/3 cups` powdered sugar
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `12 tbsp` unsalted butter
* `3 cups` sugar
* `8` large eggs
* `1 cup` fresh lilikoi juice

### Directions

1. Extract the juice from lilikoi by cutting it in half then scoop out the contents into a blender.
2. Turn on the blender at low speed for a few minutes to separate the seeds from the pulp and juice. Strain it through a mesh. Measure out 1 cup of the juice and set aside.
3. For the shortbread crust, sift 2 1/2 cups of flour into a large bowl. Also sift in the powdered sugar and salt. Whisk together. Melt the butter and combine it in the bowl until it looks crumbly.
4. Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper. Pour in the crumble mixture. Pat down the mixture with your hands or anything with a flat surface. Bake it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes or until it is a light golden brown. Set aside to cool.
5. To make the lilikoi filling, combine the sugar and flour in a large bowl. Whisk it together. Add in the lilikoi juice and eggs. Mix until it is combined well. Pour the mixture onto the finished shortbread crust.
6. Bake it in the oven for another 25 minute. It will look a little wobbly in the middles, but if the sides are firm, it is ready to take out from the oven. Let it cool for an hour, then chill in the fridge for two hours or more.
7. Cut the lilikoi bars into squares. For clean cuts, wipe your blade in between cuts. Sprinkle or dust on more powdered sugar. Serve and enjoy these onolicious lilikoi bars!

### Notes

- If you are substituting the fresh lilikoi juice for canned juice or pulp, you may need to adjust the sugar ratio.
