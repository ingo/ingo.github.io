This recipe was inspired by the author's trip to Norway for the 2016 Homebrewers Weekend in Drammen. The author was introduced to kveik, a traditional Norwegian farmhouse yeast, and decided to experiment with it by combining it with juniper and smoke. The result is a unique beer that is both intriguing and refreshing.

### Ingredients

* `20 oz` Simpsons Golden Promise
* `10 oz` Weyermann Floor Malted Bohemian Dark
* `10 oz` Weyermann Oak Smoked Wheat
* `10 oz` Weyermann Rye Malt
* `10 oz` Weyermann Beech Smoked Barley Malt
* `2 oz` Weyermann Carared
* `60 g` Juniper Tips for Hot Liquor Tank
* `60 g` Juniper Tips for Mash
* `60 g` Juniper Tips for 60 min
* `2.25 oz` Mixture (Pellets, ~4.50% AA) for 60 min
* `60 g` Juniper Tips for 30 min
* `1.00 oz` Hallertau (Pellets, 4.50% AA) for 15 min
* `90 g` Juniper Tips for 0 min

### Directions

1. Start with a Sacch Rest for 50 min at 156F.
2. Add 60 g Juniper Tips to the Hot Liquor Tank.
3. Add 60 g Juniper Tips to the Mash.
4. Add 60 g Juniper Tips at 60 min.
5. Add 2.25 oz Mixture (Pellets, ~4.50% AA) at 60 min.
6. Add 60 g Juniper Tips at 30 min.
7. Add 1.00 oz Hallertau (Pellets, 4.50% AA) at 15 min.
8. Add 90 g Juniper Tips at 0 min.

### Notes

For a more authentic result, move all of the juniper to the HLT and do a longer infusion. Opt for a Bohemian Dark (or Munich) for the entire base in place of the Golden Promise. Go darker on the Carared maybe CaraMunich II, and add a touch of Carafa as originally planned. This will not necessarily make a better beer, but it will be more in line with the original target.
