Tandoori Chicken is a popular Indian dish known for its rich, vibrant flavors. The chicken is marinated in a mix of spices and yogurt, then roasted to achieve a smoky, charred effect. This recipe requires overnight marination for the flavors to fully penetrate the chicken, making it a perfect dish to prepare ahead of time.

### Ingredients

* `4` chicken marylands
* `2 tsp` tumeric powder
* `3 tsp` chilli powder
* `2` lemons
* `1 cup` hung yoghurt
* `6 cloves` grated garlic
* `1 large nob` grated ginger
* `2 tbsp` paprika (not smoked)
* `1 tbsp` garam masala
* `1 tsp` cumin powder
* `1 tsp` coriander powder
* `1 tsp` salt
* `3 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `2-3 drops` red food colouring (optional)

### Directions

1. Slice deep cuts into chicken, then massage a little turmeric, chilli powder, and lemon juice all over and into incisions. Place aside.
2. Heat oil in a shallow pan and carefully cook paprika, garam masala, coriander, 1 tsp of the chilli powder, and cumin powder until fragrant. Turn off heat and allow oil and spice mix to completely cool.
3. Place chicken in a bowl with yoghurt, ginger/garlic, spice/oil mixture, juice of 1 lemon, salt, and red food colouring, and mix well massaging yoghurt marinade thoroughly into chicken. Marinate overnight.
4. Preheat oven to 220 degree Celsius. Take chicken out of marinade shaking off excess (reserve marinade), and place on a rack and roast for 20 minutes.
5. Take out of oven and turn pieces over, and baste chicken with reserved marinade, then roast for a further 20 minutes or until chicken cooked. Grill/broil under a high heat for a few minutes to get the charring effect before serving.
