This delicious dessert recipe was created by Megan Scott, a renowned chef known for her innovative and easy-to-make recipes. The No-Churn Roasted Banana Dulce de Leche Ice Cream is no exception, offering a rich flavor that comes from caramelized bananas, canned dulce de leche, and brown sugar. This ice cream doesn't require a churn, making it a perfect treat for those hot summer days when you want something sweet but don't want to spend hours in the kitchen.

### Ingredients

* `2` ripe bananas
* `1 can` dulce de leche
* `1/2 cup` brown sugar
* `2 cups` heavy cream
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract

### Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Slice the bananas into 1/2-inch thick rounds and arrange them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the banana slices evenly with the brown sugar.
3. Roast the bananas in the preheated oven until the sugar is caramelized and the bananas are soft, about 15 minutes. Allow the bananas to cool completely.
4. In a large bowl, combine the cooled bananas, dulce de leche, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Use an immersion blender or a stand blender to puree the mixture until smooth.
5. Pour the banana mixture into a lidded container and freeze until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.
6. Serve the ice cream in bowls or cones, and enjoy!

### Notes

- The ice cream can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.
- For a dairy-free version, replace the heavy cream with a non-dairy milk of your choice.
