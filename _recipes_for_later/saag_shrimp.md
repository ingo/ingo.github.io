Saag comes in so many ingenious variations. Leafy greens, such as spinach, amaranth, mustard greens or fenugreek, make up the bulk. This version, adapted from the chef Pourin Singh’s recipe at Le Taj in Montreal, is made with plump shrimp, which add a complementary brininess. The secret to Mr. Singh’s version is the freshness of his ingredients: the spices, the spinach, the shrimp and even the chopped tomato garnish. Serve while still warm, alongside steamed fluffy basmati rice and fresh naan, topped with green chile chutney, tamarind chutney or fresh kachumbari for a lovely pop of acid and heat.

### Ingredients

#### For the Spice Blend

* `1 tsp` ground turmeric
* `½ tsp` ground ginger
* `½ tsp` ground cumin
* `½ tsp` ground coriander
* `¼ to ½ tsp` ground cayenne
* `¼ tsp` garlic powder
* `¼ tsp` onion powder

#### For the Shrimp

* `1 lb` peeled, deveined large shrimp, tails off
* Salt
* `3 tbsp` ghee or neutral oil, such as grapeseed or safflower
* `1 tsp` whole cumin seeds
* `1` large yellow onion, minced
* `1 (1-inch)` piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and grated
* `3` garlic cloves, grated
* `1 tbsp` tomato paste
* `1` medium fresh tomato, chopped
* `½ cup` fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped
* `1 lb` fresh baby spinach, roughly chopped using a sharp knife or by pulsing in a food processor
* `½ cup` heavy cream or unsweetened coconut cream
* Steamed rice, naan, green chile chutney, tamarind chutney and fresh kachumbari, or a combination, for serving

### Directions

1. Make the spice blend: In a small bowl, combine turmeric, ginger, cumin, coriander, cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder.
2. Toss the shrimp with 2 teaspoons of the spice blend and a light sprinkle of salt. Set aside.
3. Heat a large shallow skillet over medium-high. Add the ghee and cumin seeds, and toast until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the onion, cook until softened and translucent, stirring frequently, 5 minutes.
4. Add the remaining spice blend, stir and toast until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the ginger, garlic and tomato paste. Stir and cook until the tomato paste deepens in color, about 1 minute. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the chopped tomato for garnish. Add the remaining chopped tomato, about half of the chopped cilantro and ½ cup water. Increase the heat to high and bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook the sauce, stirring until it thickens and reduces (about three-fourths of the original volume), 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt.
5. Add the shrimp to the skillet all at once and stir to coat with the sauce. Add the spinach in two batches, wilting the first batch before adding the second, and season with salt. Cook on high heat, stirring occasionally, until spinach is softened, shrimp is cooked through and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and adjust the seasoning to taste with more salt, if necessary.
6. Remove from heat and garnish with the reserved chopped tomatoes and the cilantro. Serve over steamed rice and warm, pillowy naan. Top the saag with green chile chutney, tamarind chutney or fresh kachumbari for a lovely pop of acid and heat.

### Notes

- This dish can be made with a variety of proteins, including tofu or paneer for a vegetarian version. If using tofu, dust with the spice mix and sauté in another pan before adding to the dish in step 5. If using paneer, simply replace the shrimp with paneer. If you want to avoid cream or coconut cream you can blend a small amount of raw cashews into the sauce.
