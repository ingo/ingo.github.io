This recipe for homemade pita bread comes from Serious Eats. It's a simple recipe that yields soft, fluffy pitas perfect for sandwiches or dipping into hummus.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` water (105–110°F)
* `1 tbsp` extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the bowl
* `1 tbsp` granulated sugar
* `2 1/4 tsp` [instant yeast](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/03/all-about-dry-yeast-instant-active-dry-fast-acting-and-more.html)
* `1 tsp` kosher salt
* `1/2 cup` whole wheat flour
* `2 cups` all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

### Directions

1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine water, oil, sugar, yeast, salt, and whole wheat flour until combined and smooth. Stir in all-purpose flour until the mixture comes together into a shaggy mass.
2. Knead the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or until it becomes smooth and very elastic, adding only very small amounts of extra flour if dough is extremely sticky. Alternatively, knead dough at low speed in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment until dough is very elastic and smooth, about 8 minutes.
3. Form dough into a smooth ball. Lightly oil a clean mixing bowl and place dough inside, then rub oiled hands over the top of the dough. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
4. Place a baking steel or 12-inch cast iron skillet on the top oven rack and preheat oven to 500°F. Line a plate with a large, clean kitchen towel and set aside.
5. Punch down the dough, transfer to a lightly floured work surface, and cut into 6 even pieces. Form each dough piece into an even ball. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes.
6. Roll each piece of dough into about a 7-inch circle, no more than 1/4 inch thick. Place dough disks on a lightly floured surface, cover with a damp towel, and let proof until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.
7. Bake pitas on the steel top side down. If using a cast iron skillet, bake one pita at a time. Bake until pitas have puffed and are slightly golden around the edges, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to over-bake.
8. Place baked pitas onto towel-lined plate and wrap with the overhanging towel. Repeat with any remaining pitas.
9. For an extra-charred finish, heat a cast iron skillet on the stovetop over high heat until smoking. Briefly heat each side until charred in a few spots, about 30 seconds. Return pita to towel and cover. Repeat with remaining pitas and serve immediately.

### Notes

When kneading the dough, it should be slightly tacky, not dry. This recipe may be doubled. Pitas can be baked ahead of time and frozen, with parchment layered between them, then wrapped in foil and plastic wrap. Defrost, then toast in skillet as per recipe.
