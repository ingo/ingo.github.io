### Ingredients

* `500-600 g` tapioca flour/starch
* `3` Eggs
* `250 g` grated Gouda cheese (or Cheddar)
* `70 g` grated Parmesan
* `1 tbsp` Salt
* `180 ml` Milk
* `120 g` butter

### Directions

1. Put tapioca flour and salt in a bowl.
2. Heat up butter and milk in a saucepan until it bubbles, then add to the flour and salt, mix well with a wooden spoon.
3. Mix in the 2 cheeses and let it cool a bit so your eggs don't get cooked, then add those.
4. Now sometimes you only need 500g tapioca flour, sometimes a lot more, so now you'll see how much you need depending on your dough. It should be firm enough so you can roll it into a log, but still a little wet and sticky.
5. Once your dough has reached the perfect consistency, roll it into a log and cut off little discs, 3-4cm thick.
6. Roll those into balls and put them on a baking tray. Bake for 15-20 minutes until a little browned at 200 degree Celsius (preheated).
7. Eat while still warm. They might look undercooked on the inside, but that's the tapioca and the cheese.

### Notes

The dough consistency is key in this recipe. It should be firm enough to roll into a log but still a bit wet and sticky. If it's too dry, add more tapioca flour. Enjoy while still warm for the best taste.
