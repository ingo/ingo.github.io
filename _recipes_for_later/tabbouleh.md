This Tabbouleh recipe is a fusion of Claudia Rodin's traditional recipe and the unique spice mixture from the Jerusalem cookbook. It's a refreshing salad perfect for a light lunch or as a side dish.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` bulgur
* `2 cups` boiling water
* `1 cup` finely chopped fresh parsley
* `½ cup` finely chopped fresh mint
* `2` medium tomatoes, diced
* `1` cucumber, diced
* `3 tbsp` olive oil
* `1` lemon, juiced
* `1 tsp` Jerusalem spice mixture

### Directions

1. Place the bulgur in a large bowl and pour the boiling water over it. Let it soak until the water is absorbed and the bulgur is tender, about 20-30 minutes.
2. Once the bulgur is ready, add the chopped parsley, mint, diced tomatoes, and cucumber to the bowl.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and Jerusalem spice mixture. Pour this dressing over the salad and toss everything together until well combined.
4. Let the salad sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

### Notes

The Jerusalem spice mixture adds a unique flavor to this traditional Tabbouleh recipe. If you can't find it, you can make your own by mixing together equal parts ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, and paprika.
