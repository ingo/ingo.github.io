### Ingredients

* `3 cups` split peas (1 package)
* `6 cups` of water or broth
* `1` yellow onion
* `1/2` yellow onion
* `1` celery stalk
* `1` carrot (optional)
* `1` ham bone, several turkey bones (with meat attached), or smoked sausage
* `2` bay leaves
* Salt and whole peppercorns
* Chopped parsley for garnish

### Directions

1. If using bones, just cover them in a large pot with water. Bring to boil and pour off the water.
2. Then cover the bones again with water and/or broth, add 1 onion whole, bay leafs, peppercorns, salt, carrot, celery. Bring to boil and let simmer for an hour.
3. Strain the broth into a pot, discard the rest of the ingredients and pick off and reserve any meat from the bones.
4. Wash and drain the peas. Finely dice the remaining half onion and add it to the broth with the washed peas. Bring to boil and let simmer 1-2 hours until peas get mushy.
5. If using sausage, cut and fry the sausage in a separate pan and add to the soup. Add the parsley as a garnish.
