Der Falke Kellerbier is a unique blend of British cask ale and German malts and hops. This lager style beer has an atypical flavor profile that can be tweaked to represent a German ESB or a Continental IPA.

### Ingredients

* `6 lb (2.7 kg)` Vienna malt
* `3 lb (1.4 kg)` Pilsner malt
* `4 oz (113 g)` Carafa II
* `4 oz (113 g)` Melanoidin malt
* `0.38 oz (11 g)` each Northern Brewer [8% AA] and Hallertau [4.5% AA] at 60 minutes
* `0.38 oz (11 g)` each Northern Brewer and Hallertau at 30 minutes
* `0.38 oz (11 g)` each Northern Brewer and Hallertau at 10 minutes
* Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager)

### Directions

1. Mill the grains and mix with `3 gallons (11.2 l)` of `163°F (73°C)` strike water to reach a mash temperature of `152°F (67°C)`. Hold this temperature for 60 minutes.
2. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then run off into the kettle.
3. Sparge the grains with `4.3 gallons (16.5 l)` and top up as necessary to obtain `6 gallons (23 l)` of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, following the hops schedule.
4. After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about `50°F (10°C)`. Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast.
5. Ferment at `50°F (18°C)` for five days, and then allow to free-rise, but not higher than `64°F (18°C)`. Upon reaching terminal gravity, cold crash and bottle or keg the beer, and carbonate to about 1 volume of CO2 for “cask-feel” lager or 2 volumes for more conventional carbonation.

### Notes

- Drink this beer as soon as it’s carbonated! Kellerbier is, by tradition, a “young” beer and should be consumed early, rough edges and all. Some versions exhibit signs of incomplete fermentation (acetaldehyde, for example) but here we’re relying on the Vienna malt to provide a nice raw graininess. Don’t worry if it isn’t clear yet: hazy versions of this beer abound, and you needn’t take any particular steps to clear it up!
