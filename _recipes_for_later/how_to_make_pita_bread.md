title: How to Make Pita Bread
---
The pita bread is a staple in Greek cuisine, used to scoop up dips and wrap souvlaki and gyro. While you can buy pita bread from your local grocer or Greek market, nothing beats homemade. This recipe, inspired by Vefa Alexiadou and tweaked to my liking, includes cornmeal in the flour mix and equal parts water and milk in the wet ingredients for a softer pita bread.

### Ingredients

* `3 cups` all-purpose flour
* `1/2 cup` fine cornmeal
* `1 1/4 tsp` salt
* `1 tbsp` instant yeast
* `2 tsp` sugar
* `2 tbsp` olive oil or softened butter
* `3/4 cup` warm (body temperature) water
* `3/4 cup` warm milk
* Extra cornmeal for dusting
* Cooking spray

### Directions

1. In the bowl of your stand mixer, add your flour, cornmeal, yeast, sugar and salt and stir with a fork.
2. Attach the hook, add the water, milk, olive oil while mixing. Add dough if needed until the dough is no longer sticky and doesn’t stick to the bowl.
3. Divide into six pieces and roll out into 8 to 10 -inch rounds that are about 1/4 inch thick. Dust both sides lightly with cornmeal and lightly poke the surface of your pita breads with the tines of a fork.
4. Place a heavy cast-iron skillet (non-stick pan is fine as well) and heat to medium. Apply cooking spray on the pan. Place a large tea towel on a round plate.
5. Place your pita dough on the hot skillet and fry the bread for a couple of minutes a side or until they start to puff and bubble up. Flip and fry the other side.
6. Place the pita bread on the tea towel and cover. Wipe the pan with paper towel, apply more cooking spray and fry the remaining pita breads.
7. Serve warm or allow to cool inside the kitchen towel until cooled. Store in a sealed plastic bag for up to a week or freeze.

### Notes

- The amount of pita bread units depends on how big you roll them out to. I like big pita breads. I used a large cast iron skillet in this instance. You should be good for at least 8, depending on the size you like them to be.
