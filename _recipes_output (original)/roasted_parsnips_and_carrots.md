This recipe for Roasted Parsnips and Carrots is a classic side dish that brings out the sweet, earthy flavors of these two root vegetables. It's a recipe from the Barefoot Contessa, known for her simple and delicious dishes.

### Ingredients

* `1 lb` parsnips
* `1 lb` carrots
* `3 tbsp` olive oil
* `Salt and pepper` to taste
* `2 tbsp` fresh dill

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. If the parsnips and carrots are very thick, cut them in half lengthwise. Slice each diagonally in 1-inch-thick slices. The vegetables will shrink while cooking, so don't make the pieces too small.
3. Place the cut vegetables on a sheet pan. Add the olive oil, salt, and pepper and toss well.
4. Roast for 20 to 40 minutes, depending on the size of the vegetables, tossing occasionally, until the parsnips and carrots are just tender.
5. Sprinkle with dill and serve hot.

### Notes

Remember, the vegetables will shrink while cooking, so don't cut the pieces too small. The roasting time will also depend on the size of the vegetables.
