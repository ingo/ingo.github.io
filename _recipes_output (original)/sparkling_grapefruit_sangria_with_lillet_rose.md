**Note:** To make simple syrup, combine `1 cup` water with `1 cup` sugar in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Cool before using. Simple syrup will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

### Ingredients

* `15` fresh mint leaves
* `1/4 cup` simple syrup (see note above)
* `1 cup` fresh grapefruit juice, from about 2 Ruby Red grapefruits, plus `1/2` of one grapefruit, peel intact, cut into rough chunks
* `1 cup` Lillet Rosé
* `1 bottle` Cava, chilled

### Directions

1. In the bottom of a pitcher, gently muddle together the mint leaves and simple syrup. Add grapefruit chunks, grapefruit juice, and Lillet Rosé. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.
2. When ready to serve, add Cava to the pitcher and stir gently. Serve over ice.
