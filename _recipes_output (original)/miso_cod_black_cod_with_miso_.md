### Ingredients

* `4 fillets` sablefish (gindara) (you can also use salmon, sea bass, etc.)
* `2 tsp` kosher/sea salt (use half for table salt)
* `2 Tbsp` sake

#### Miso Marinade:

* `6 Tbsp` miso (I use Saikyo Miso. You can substitute it with white miso)
* `3 Tbsp` mirin (if you use white miso, use 4 Tbsp mirin)
* `3 Tbsp` sake

### Directions

1. Gather all the ingredients. As you will be marinating this fish for a few days, select the freshest fish possible.

#### 2 to 3 Days Beforehand

1. Sprinkle salt over the fish and set aside for 30 minutes. Salt will draw excess moisture and any fishy smell from the fish.  
2. Put 6 Tbsp miso, 3 Tbsp mirin, and 3 Tbsp sake for the Miso Marinade in a bowl.
3. Mix all together and pour the marinade into a flat bottom airtight container.
4. Pour 2 Tbsp sake over the fish to rinse off the salt. Gently pat dry with paper towel to remove the moisture. Do not wash the fish under water.
5. Place the fish in the container and coat both sides with the marinade.
6. Slather the fillets with the marinade. Cover the lid and keep in the fridge **for 2-3 days**.  You can freeze up to 2-3 weeks.

#### To Cook the Fish

1. Preheat oven to 400 ºF (200 ºC). With your fingers, remove the marinade off the fish completely. Do not leave excess miso on the fish; otherwise, the fish will burn easily.  
2. Place the fish skin side up on baking pan lined with parchment paper or silicone baking sheet.
3. Bake the fish until the edges are browned and the flesh is cooked through, about 20-25 minutes. Do not flip the fish while baking as the flesh is very flaky.
4. Carefully remove the fish with a spatula, and remove any burnt miso around the fish. Serve immediately. I serve the fish with thinly sliced red radish and a small green leaf from my backyard for additional color.

### Notes

**Miso:** Traditionally we use _saikyo miso_ (西京味噌); however, if you can't find it, you can use white miso (白味噌) instead.

**Sake:** Sake is used to clean and remove the unwanted odor of the fish. You can't replace with water even though sometimes water is used as replacement in some recipes. We will marinate the fish for a longer time, and water can go bad and ruin the marinade and fish.

**Mirin:** Typically mirin can be replaced with water and sugar, but for this recipe, please do not use water. Use sugar only. For 1 Tbsp mirin, use 1 tsp sugar.
