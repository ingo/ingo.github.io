Naan is one of the easiest flatbreads to make - but it really should be cooked at a high temperature. This Naan recipe - adapted from Anjum Anand's cookbook - is amazingly simple, fast, and has great texture and flavour. Cooking the Naan in a wood fired pizza oven - like the Ooni Pro Pizza Oven - gives results very close to cooking in a Tandoor.

### Ingredients

* `300g` all purpose flour, plus more for dusting counter
* `5 mL` sugar
* `3 mL` coarse salt
* `5 mL` active dry yeast
* `15 mL` vegetable oil
* `60 mL` plain yogourt
* `140 mL` room temp water +/- 

### Directions

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer; mix together the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.
2. Add the yogourt, place the bowl on the mixer with the dough hook and turn on to med-low.
3. Slowly pour in the water, and let the hook gather in the flour to form a ball.
4. Once a ball has formed, turn the mixer up a notch, and knead for 6-8 minutes.
5. Remove the dough from the mixer, place it in an oiled bowl, cover and leave on the counter until doubled in size.
6. Preheat the oven as high as it will go - 260ºC (550ºF) - and place a large baking sheet on the upper shelf. (Or a pizza stone, or baking steel)
7. Divide the dough into 6 balls.
8. Pat them out into an oval or tear drop shape.
9. Repeat and cook three at a time on the heated baking sheet.
10. Bake until the dough puffs up and the underside is a deep golden brown, then flip and bake another 30–40 seconds or so.
11. Repeat with the next three.
12. Serve hot.

### Notes

* You can also grill these on the BBQ, or cook them as we did in a pizza oven.
