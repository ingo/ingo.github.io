This recipe for Spicy Tuna Handrolls is a modified version of a restaurant-style recipe. It's a great way to enjoy sushi at home, with a unique spicy mayo that adds a kick to the sushi rolls. The recipe uses a variety of ingredients to create a unique and flavorful experience.

### Ingredients

* `1/2 cup` Kewpie mayo
* `1-2 tbsp` chili powder
* `1-2 tsp` sesame oil
* `1 pinch` salt
* `1 dab` sriracha
* `1 sushi grade` tuna
* `1 bunch` green onions
* `1 hefty amount` masago (smelt roe)
* `1 optional` tobikko
* `1/2 sheets` nori
* `1 small handful` sushi rice

### Directions

1. Make the spicy mayo by combining Kewpie mayo, chili powder, sesame oil, salt, and a dab of sriracha in a bowl. Mix well and adjust seasoning as necessary.
2. Cube the sushi grade tuna into about 1/4" pieces.
3. Slice the green onions as thinly as possible using a sharp knife.
4. Mix a hefty amount of masago (and tobikko if desired) into the cubed tuna.
5. Add the spicy mayo to the tuna and masago mixture and mix well.
6. Start with half sheets of nori and distribute a small handful of sushi rice on one half of the nori.
7. Add your spicy tuna in a small lump on top of the rice.
8. Fold the bottom corner of the nori up and tuck it around and under your filling so that you get a rough cone shape.
9. Let the nori wrap around the cone until you have what essentially looks like a handroll.
10. Optional: If you want to keep that flap tucked in, smear a grain of rice onto it so that it sticks.
11. Enjoy fresh when the nori is still crisp or dip in soy sauce!

### Notes

The spicy mayo is a key part of this recipe. Feel free to adjust the amount of chili powder and sesame oil to suit your taste. The nori should be crisp when served. If you can't find Kewpie mayo, you can substitute regular mayo.
