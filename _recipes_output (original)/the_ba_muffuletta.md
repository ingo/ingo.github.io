title: The BA Muffuletta
category: Entrees
description: There is no better beach or picnic sandwich: It feeds a crowd, gets better as it sits, and is a hearty meal built inside a loaf of bread. Unless you live in New Orleans and can get the real thing, opt for a ciabatta or other loaf with a sturdy but not too crusty exterior.

### Ingredients

For the olive salad:

* `5` oil-packed Calabrian chiles or `1` fresh Fresno chile, chopped
* `1` shallot, finely chopped
* `2` garlic cloves, finely chopped
* `1 cup` Castelvetrano or green Cerignola olives, pitted, chopped
* `3/4 cup` Picholine or Spanish olives, pitted, chopped
* `1/2 cup` chopped drained piquillo peppers or roasted red peppers from a jar
* `1/3 cup` olive oil
* `3 tbsp` chopped drained capers
* `3 tbsp` red wine vinegar
* `1 tbsp` chopped oregano
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper

For assembly:

* `1` large ciabatta loaf or other soft Italian bread
* `1/4 pound` thinly sliced Genoa salami
* `1/4 pound` thinly sliced hot capocollo
* `1/4 pound` thinly sliced provolone cheese
* `1/2 pound` mozzarella
* `1/4 pound` thinly sliced mortadella
* `1/4 pound` thinly sliced prosciutto

### Directions

#### Make the olive salad:

1. Combine Calabrian chiles, shallot, garlic, both olives, piquillo peppers, oil, capers, vinegar, and oregano in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper.

#### To assemble:

2. Split bread in half along the equator line. Divide olive salad, including any liquid, between halves. Lay salami on bottom half of bread, followed by capocollo, provolone, mozzarella, mortadella, and prosciutto. Close sandwich and wrap tightly in plastic. Place between 2 baking sheets and weigh down with a heavy pot or two to flatten slightly. Let sit at room temperature, turning over halfway, 1â€“3 hours before cutting into wedges to serve.

### Notes

Olive salad can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
