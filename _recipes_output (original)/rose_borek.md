### Directions

1. In a bowl, place the eggs, oil and milk. Mix them with a whisk. Take 1 cup of this mixture and set aside to use later for the top.
2. If using Turkish yufka, place all the yufka sheets on top of each other. Cut them in four by obtaining equal triangle like pieces. Then, put 2 tbsp of milk mixture on every piece and spread with the back of spoon or use a brush to spread all over. 
3. Place 2 tbsp of the filling on the wide edge and spread evenly through the edge. Flap the wide edge inside and roll it up till the end (make sure not to roll too tight). Then, again roll this long piece forming a spiral shape [\(see the picture\).](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tqAuwGaWySU/SqMrSz3xN7I/AAAAAAAAHGo/v6-J6KBevDQ/s1600-h/rose+borek+(gul+borek)3.jpg)
4. Repeat the same procedure for each of the yufka piece.
5. If using Phyllo Pastry, use two piece of pastry sheets at the same time to form a rose borek (two sheets approximately have the same thickness as one yufka sheet). Place the filling on the wide edge of the rectangle sheet and then roll it up till the other end. Give the spiral shape and use the same procedure as you’ve used for the yufka.
6. Place the rose shape boreks side by side in a greased Pyrex dish (do not leave any room in between). Pour the remaining liquid mixture on top of the borek evenly and sprinkle with nigella and sesame seeds.
7. Preheat the oven to 350 F(180 C) and bake for about 30-45 minutes, until it turns golden brown. Serve warm.
