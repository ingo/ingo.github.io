Biryani is a South Asian one-pot dish in which lamb, mutton, beef, chicken, seafood, or a mixture of vegetables is layered with rice. The layering technique is what differentiates biryani from other rice dishes, like a pilaf or pulao.

### Ingredients

* `1 kg` lamb, cut into 2-inch pieces
* `2 cups` plain yogurt
* `2 tbsp` salt
* `2 tbsp` ginger, grated
* `2 tbsp` garlic, minced
* `2 large` onions, thinly sliced
* `2 cups` basmati rice
* `1 tbsp` lemon juice
* `2 tbsp` vegetable oil
* `1 tsp` saffron threads
* `1/2 cup` warm milk
* `2 tbsp` rosewater
* `2 tbsp` pandan water
* `1 tsp` turmeric
* `2` cardamom pods
* `1` cinnamon stick
* `1` mace blade
* `1/4 cup` fresh cilantro, chopped
* `1/4 cup` fresh mint, chopped

### Directions

1. Marinate the lamb in a mixture of yogurt, salt, ginger, and garlic in the refrigerator overnight.
2. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until they are caramelized. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnish.
3. Add the marinated lamb to the pan with the remaining onions. Cook until the lamb is tender.
4. While the lamb is cooking, rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice in a large pot of boiling water with the lemon juice and vegetable oil until it is half-cooked. Drain and set aside.
5. Sprinkle the saffron threads over the warm milk and let it sit for a few minutes to infuse.
6. Layer the half-cooked rice over the cooked lamb in the pan. Sprinkle the saffron-infused milk, rosewater, and pandan water over the rice. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and cook on low heat for 30 minutes.
7. Remove the pan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Uncover the pan and fluff the rice with a fork.
8. Garnish the biryani with the reserved caramelized onions, fresh cilantro, and mint. Serve hot.

### Notes

This recipe can also be made with chicken, beef, or vegetables. Adjust the cooking time as needed. The biryani can be served with plain yogurt or a raita.
