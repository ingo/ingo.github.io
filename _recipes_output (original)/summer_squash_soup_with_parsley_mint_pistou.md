This soup is a perfect blend of summer squash and a refreshing parsley mint pistou. It's a great way to enjoy the flavors of summer in a hearty and satisfying dish.

### Ingredients

#### For squash soup
* `3/4 stick` unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* `1` medium onion, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `2 lb` yellow summer squash, halved and thinly sliced
* `2` carrots, thinly sliced
* `1` yellow-fleshed potato (1/2 lb), peeled, halved
* `4 cups` chicken stock or reduced-sodium chicken broth

#### For pistou
* `3/4 cup` loosely packed fresh mint leaves
* `1/2 cup` loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs
* `1` large scallion, chopped (1/2 cup)
* `1/4 cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `2 tbsp` water
* `1/4 tsp` salt

### Directions

1. Melt butter in a 6- to 8-quart wide heavy pot over moderate heat, then cook onion with salt, stirring, until softened, about 8 minutes. 
2. Add squash, carrots, potato, and stock and bring to a boil. 
3. Reduce heat, then simmer, partially covered, until vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. 
4. Remove from heat and cool soup, uncovered, 10 minutes.
5. Working in batches, purée soup in a blender until smooth (use caution when blending hot liquids) and transfer to a bowl. 
6. Return purée to cleaned pot and thin with water if desired; simmer 3 minutes. Season with salt.
7. Pulse mint, parsley, and scallion in a food processor until finely chopped. With motor running, add oil in a stream, then add water and salt, blending until incorporated.
8. Swirl 1 tablespoon pistou into each bowl of soup.

### Notes

* Soup (without pistou) can be made 2 days ahead and cooled, uncovered, then chilled, covered. Reheat before serving, thinning with additional water if desired.
* Pistou keeps, its surface covered with plastic wrap, chilled, 3 days. Bring to room temperature before using.
