This Italian-inspired dish is a true comfort food, perfect for a cozy dinner at home. The beef cheeks become incredibly tender when slow-cooked, and the rich red wine sauce is simply irresistible.

### Ingredients

* `3 tbsp` olive oil, separated
* `1.5 kg/3lb` beef cheeks (4 large or 6 small beef cheeks)
* `1` onion (white, brown or yellow), roughly diced
* `1` celery stalk, roughly diced
* `1` carrot, roughly diced
* `4` garlic cloves, minced
* `6` stems of fresh thyme or `1 1/2 tsp` dried thyme leaves
* `4` dried bay leaves (or 3 fresh bay leaves)
* `1 cup (250 ml)` beef stock (broth)
* `2 cups (500 ml)` red wine (full bodied eg. cabernet sauvignon or merlot)
* `2 - 3 tsp` salt, separated
* Black pepper

### Directions

1. Prepare the beef cheeks: cut off any large, fatty membrane. Pat dry then use 1 tsp of salt and black pepper to season the beef all over.
2. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Sear half the beef cheeks on each side until nicely browned. Remove beef cheeks onto a plate, repeat with remaining cheeks.
3. Turn down the heat to medium high and heat the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil. Add garlic and onion. Sauté for 3 minutes until onion is becoming translucent.
4. Add the celery and carrots, sauté for a further 3 minutes.
5. Follow directions for your chosen cooking method below.

#### Slow Cooker Directions

1. Pour the onion mixture into the slow cooker and place the beef cheeks on top.
2. Pour the wine into the pot and return to heat. Turn the heat up to high, bring to simmer and let it simmer for 1 minute (to cook out the wine a bit). Scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan so it mixes in with the wine.
3. Pour the wine into the slow cooker, then all the remaining ingredients, starting with a pinch of salt and pepper (add more to taste later).
4. Cook in the slow cooker on Low for 8 hours or High for 6 hours for 250g/8oz size beef cheeks or Low for 10 - 12 hours or High for 8 hours for 350g/12oz beef cheeks.
5. Open the slow cooker and remove the beef cheeks. Discard the thyme stems and bay leaves.
6. Use a handheld stick blender to puree the braising liquid into a smooth Sauce - it will change from a dark brown to a lighter brown colour. 
7. Transfer liquid into saucepan, simmer on stove on medium high until the Sauce turns a darker brown colour and reduces by about 1/4 to 1/3, to a gravy consistency - about 10 minutes.
8. Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning (salt and pepper) to your taste.
9. Remove from heat, return beef cheeks to the Sauce, cover and keep warm until ready to serve.

#### Pressure Cooker Directions

1. Follow the Slow Cooker directions but cook on high in your pressure cooker for 1 hour on high for small cheeks (around 250g/8oz each).

#### Stovetop and Oven Directions

1. Pour the wine into the pot / casserole dish (with the onion mixture) and stir to scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pot. Bring wine to simmer for 1 minute.
2. Add remaining ingredients, starting with a pinch of salt and pepper (add more to taste later), then place lid on.
3. Stove: Simmer on medium low for 2 to 2 1/2 hours until the cheeks are very tender, turn at least once during cooking.
4. Oven: 160C/320F for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. 
5. Remove the beef cheeks from sauce. Discard the thyme stems and bay leaves.
6. Use a handheld stick blender to puree the braising liquid into a smooth Sauce - it will change from a dark brown to a lighter brown colour.
7. Bring the Sauce to simmer over medium heat and simmer until it turns a darker brown colour and reduces by about 1/4 to 1/3, to a gravy consistency - about 3 to 5 minutes.
8. Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning (salt and pepper) to your taste.
9. Remove from heat, return beef cheeks to the Sauce, cover and keep warm until ready to serve.

#### To Serve

1. Serve beef cheeks on Paris Mash or Creamy Mashed Cauliflower, drizzled with a generous amount of Sauce. Garnish with finely chopped parsley if desired.

### Notes

1. The beef cheeks I got were unusually large, around 350g/12oz each. Great man size portions. Usually beef cheeks are around 250g/8oz each and I get 6.
2. If you can't find beef cheeks, substitute with any other cut of beef suitable for slow cooking. Boneless beef short ribs is ideal! Cut them into 250g/8oz pieces.
3. Leftover beef cheeks and sauce can be kept in the freezer for 3 months.
