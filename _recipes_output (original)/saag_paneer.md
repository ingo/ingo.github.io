This recipe for Saag Paneer is a classic Indian dish that is full of flavor. The combination of paneer cheese and a blend of spices makes for a hearty and satisfying meal. While everyone has their own version of this dish, this recipe is a personal favorite.

### Ingredients

* `1` block paneer, cut into cubes
* `2 tbsp` canola oil or ghee
* `1` red onion, coarsely chopped
* `6` cloves garlic, chopped
* `6` quarter-sized pieces of ginger (don't bother peeling)
* `1 tbsp` garam masala
* `1/4 tsp` turmeric
* `1/4 cup` tomato paste
* `1 tsp` kosher salt
* `1 lb` spinach (or a mix of spinach and other greens) coarsely chopped
* `1/2 cup` cream

### Directions

1. Saute the paneer, turning occasionally, until crispy and browned on a few sides. Remove paneer from pan and set aside. This step is optional.
2. Saute the onion, garlic, and ginger, stirring often, until the onion is tender and beginning to brown. Stir in tomato paste and cook another minute. Remove from heat and stir in garam masala and turmeric.
3. Transfer the mixture to a blender, along with `3/4 cup` of water. Puree until smooth. Return mixture to pan. Use another `1/4 cup` of water to rinse out the blender (just dump it in and run it for a few seconds), and transfer that to the pan as well.
4. Over medium heat, add the spinach - a few handfuls at a time if necessary - and cook covered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick and the spinach is very tender.
5. Add the paneer, salt, and cream. Cook until the paneer is warmed through.

### Notes

Instead of paneer, you can use meat (just cook covered until the meat is cooked through), mushrooms, potatoes, chickpeas, tofu, etc.
