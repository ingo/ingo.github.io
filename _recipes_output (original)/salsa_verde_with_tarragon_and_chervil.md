Salsa verde means "green sauce" in both Italian and Spanish. In this version, fresh tarragon gives the salsa a nice summery quality. The salsa verde also goes well with grilled fish like swordfish or tuna steaks, as well as in sandwiches or swirled into soups. If chervil proves difficult to find, a mixture of extra tarragon and parsley is a fine substitute.

### Ingredients

* `1` medium red onion, finely chopped
* `2 tbsp` red wine vinegar
* Salt
* `2 tbsp` salted capers
* `¾ cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `4 tbsp` freshly squeezed lemon juice
* `1 tsp` finely grated lemon zest
* `3` garlic cloves, finely chopped
* `½ cup` chopped flat-leaf parsley
* `½ cup` chopped chervil
* `¼ cup` chopped tarragon
* `¼ cup` minced chives
* Freshly ground pepper

### Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine the chopped red onion with the vinegar and a pinch of salt. Let stand for 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, cover the capers with warm water and let stand for 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the capers to a work surface and finely chop them.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil with the lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, parsley, chervil, tarragon and chives. Drain the onion, squeezing out any excess vinegar, and add to the bowl along with the capers. Mix well and season with salt and pepper. Let the salsa verde stand for at least 1 hour before serving.

### Notes

The salsa verde can be refrigerated covered overnight. Bring the salsa to room temperature before serving, or serve lightly chilled. It pairs well with [Mixed Grill with Rib Eyes, Sausages and Bacon Chops](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/mixed-grill-with-rib-eyes-sausages-and-bacon-chops).
