This homebrew recipe comes from London Amateur Brewers (LAB) member Ken Bazley. Bazley earned a gold medal for this beer recipe in the 2013 UK National Homebrew Competition. It was first brewed for the Sebright Arms and was inspired by Maui Brewing’s coconut porter.

### Ingredients

* `10.8 lb (4.9 kg)` Maris Otter pale malt
* `0.55 lb (250 g)` Crystal malt
* `0.48 lb (218 g)` Chocolate malt
* `0.48 lb (218 g)` Carafa I
* `13.4 oz (380 g)` Toasted coconut flakes (secondary)
* `3.8 oz (110 g)` Black patent malt
* `0.5 oz (14 g)` Chinook hops, 13.1% a.a. (60 min)
* `0.7 oz (20 g)` Willamette hops, 6.3% a.a. (40 min)
* `0.5 oz (14 g)` Willamette hops, 6.3% a.a. (20 min)
* Safale US-05, rehydrated

### Directions

1. Mash grains at 152° F (67° C) for one hour. 
2. Ferment at 68° F (20° C). 
3. After fermentation, preheat oven to 150° F (66° C) and toast coconut until golden brown (about 40 minutes). Turn the coconut every 10 minutes to ensure even toasting. 
4. Rack the beer into an airtight vessel (secondary or Cornelius keg) and add the coconut loose when cool. Give the vessel a good shake every day. 
5. Bottle after 12 to 14 days. Prime to achieve 2.0 volumes of CO2.
