During the recent pandemic, everyone started baking bread, particularly sourdough – hence the yeast shortage. I, myself, tried my hand at sourdough. I was not successful. Hence my weekly no knead bread baking. But I did have a ton of discarded sourdough. So I made some pancakes. Which were of course, amazing. And then I made some biscuits. And it was legit NEXT LEVEL EPIC. The added sourdough tang knocks these biscuits right out of the park. Not to mention, the ultra flaky, light and fluffiness these biscuits encompass. Just be sure to serve them super warm with all the melted butter. And this works as an appetizer, snack or dinner. I prefer to have them for dinner though.

### Ingredients

* `302g/2 cups` all-purpose flour
* `15g/2 teaspoons` sugar
* `10g/2 teaspoons` baking powder
* `8g/1 teaspoon` kosher salt
* `5g/ 3/4 teaspoon` baking soda
* `1/2 cup` unsalted butter, frozen
* `150g/1 cup` active sourdough starter
* `1/2 cup` buttermilk (or 1/2c milk + 2 tsp vinegar left at room temperature for 10 mins)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda.
3. Grate butter using the large holes of a box grater. Stir into the flour mixture.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk together sourdough starter and buttermilk. Add to the flour mixture and stir using a rubber spatula until a soft dough forms.
5. Working on a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 2-3 times until it comes together. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 1 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Cut out 8-10 rounds using a 2-inch biscuit or cookie cutter.
6. Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet. Place into oven and bake for 14-18 minutes, or until golden brown.
7. Serve warm.

### Notes

Remember to serve them super warm with all the melted butter. This recipe works as an appetizer, snack or dinner.
