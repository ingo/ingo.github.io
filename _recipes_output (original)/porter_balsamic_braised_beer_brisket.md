This recipe showcases the harmonious relationship between brisket and beer. The ingredients are quite simple on their own, but once brought together, they create a luxurious barbecue sauce-like braising liquid which really uplifts the strong beefy flavor of the brisket.

### Ingredients

* `4 lbs` beef brisket, flat
* `1/3 cup + 1 tbsp` dry rub (use your favorite or mix `3 tbsp` kosher salt, `1 tbsp` garlic powder, `1 tbsp` onion powder, `1 tbsp` paprika and `3 tsp` black pepper)
* `3 tbsp` vegetable or olive oil
* `1` onion, chopped
* `4` cloves garlic, smashed or rough chop
* `12 oz` porter
* `2 cups` beef broth
* `1/4 cup` dark brown sugar
* `1 tbsp + 1 tsp` balsamic vinegar
* `1 tbsp` Worcestershire sauce
* `4-5` sprigs thyme
* `2` bay leaves

### Directions

1. Prepare the dry rub by mixing all the ingredients listed or measure out your favorite dry rub. Generously season the brisket all over, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, ideally overnight or even a bit longer.
2. Bring the seasoned brisket to room temperature (takes about an hour) before you begin cooking. Preheat oven to 300 F or set a slow cooker and warm the bowl.
3. Heat a large skillet or a large braiser over medium-high. Add cooking oil and sear the brisket fat cap side down first. About 5 minutes per side. Set aside and lower the heat.
4. Saute the onion and garlic cloves and deglaze with a bit of porter. Scrape off brown bits from bottom of pan. Add the rest of the porter. Add the brown sugar, balsamic, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaves and beef stock. Stir and bring to boil.
5. If using a braiser - place the brisket in the boiling liquid, cover and transfer to the oven. If using a roasting pan transfer the braising liquid to it, place the brisket in it, tightly seal with foil and transfer to the oven. If using a slow cooker transfer the braising liquid to the bowl, place the brisket in it, cover and cook on low.
6. After about 2 hours check the level of braising liquid (5 hours for slow cooker). Add an extra cup of beef stock or some water if needed. Braise until the meat is very tender when pierced with a fork. Generally about 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the oven and about 7-8 in slow cooker. Adjust time as necessary.
7. When brisket is done remove and let it cool down a bit. Slice against the grain and serve warm.

### Notes

* Do not braise a flat and point brisket cut as this will result in uneven cooking.
* You may need an additional cup of broth or water to add during braising, depending on how tightly sealed the braising vessel you use is.
