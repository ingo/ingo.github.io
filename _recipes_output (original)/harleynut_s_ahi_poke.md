Harleynut's Ahi Poké recipe is a delightful and versatile dish that can be served in various ways to suit any occasion. Whether you're hosting a dinner party, a poker night with friends, or a larger gathering, this recipe has a serving option to match.

### Ingredients

* `1kg` sashimi-grade Ahi (tuna)
* `1` baby carrot finely julienned for garnish
* `2` eschallot onions finely julienned
* `1` salad onion (Pacific or Maui onion preferred but rarely obtainable here), diced
* `1` spring onion, finely sliced for garnish
* `1 tsp` ginger (fresh grated preferred or jar minced)
* `2 tsp` minced garlic (fresh grated preferred or jar minced)
* `1/4 cup` dark soy sauce
* `1/4 cup` light soy sauce
* `1 tbsp` sesame oil
* `2 tsp` toasted sesame seeds (I like more, depends on personal taste)
* `1 cup` fresh mung bean sprouts (not canned - urgh!)
* `1 cup` fresh snow pea sprouts for garnish
* "squirt to taste" of sriracha chilli sauce
* "small squeeze" of wasabi paste (not too much)
* `2-3` Wonton wrappers per person (optional)
* Ground rock salt to taste (Hawaiian red or Himalayan pink)

### Directions

1. Cut defrosted Ahi into 1/2” cubes, grind some salt over the fish then cover and set aside to chill in the refrigerator. Use whatever salt you want, as some say "salt is just salt". However, I prefer using non-iodised salt and one that contains more trace minerals than just standard table salt.
2. Toast the sesame seeds in a small frypan until golden brown, shaking and tossing them regularly. Careful not to burn them then transfer to a saucer to cool.
3. Combine eschallots, green onion, ginger, garlic, soy, sesame oil, sesame seeds, mung bean sprouts, sriracha & wasabi in a non-reactive container and refrigerate. If wanting to intensify the flavour through the Ahi, then immediately combine with the Ahi, cover and refrigerate for a few hours. If not, wait until just before serving and combine the sauce mix with the Ahi then.
4. If making a “Poké Stack” or using wonton wrappers for eating with the Poké, fry the wrappers a couple at a time quickly in hot oil. Drain on kitchen paper and let cool.

### Serving Options

1. Poké Stack: Place some Poké onto individual serving plates, then a wonton wrapper, then Poké, then a wonton wrapper, then Poké, then top with a few snow pea sprouts, some julienned carrot and a sprinkle of sliced spring onions. If you like it spicier, add some finely sliced chillis or dried chilli flakes. Save a couple of “drips” of the sauce mix to sprinkle on top. To eat with chopsticks, “smash” the stack” so it’s all combined and the crispy wonton wrappers are in bite-size pieces. Best one for dinner parties.
2. Poké Platter: Arrange the fried wonton wrappers around the edge of a large chilled platter with the Poké piled up in the middle. Garnish over with the snow pea sprouts, carrot and spring onion. Eat using the wonton wrappers as Poké dippers or use toothpicks. Good with a few friends on a poker night.
3. Poké Spoons: Grab some disposable Chinese soup spoons (ones with the flat bases) and heap each spoon with Poké. Arrange the spoons on a clean serving tray and simply sprinkle the other garnishes over them. Good for bigger parties.
4. Stick the Poké in a bowl in the middle and just pig out with forks. Don't forget the chilled beverages!

### Chef's Tips

I personally like the “Stack”, as it presents well for guests, it’s fun to eat and the crunch of the wonton wrappers is a good texture contrast to the softness of the Ahi.
