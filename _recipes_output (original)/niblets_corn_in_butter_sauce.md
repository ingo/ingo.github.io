This recipe was born out of necessity. Every Thanksgiving, my mom serves Green Giant Niblets corn in butter sauce and I promised I would pick it up for her and bring it on Thanksgiving day. When I went to the store, they were sold out! I made this recipe and brought it already prepared to Thanksgiving dinner. Nobody was the wiser! I saved some money too, because I used store brand corn! This recipe makes a lot...you may want to half it.

### Ingredients

* `2` 16 ounce bags frozen corn (yellow "or" shoepeg white, any brand)
* `2 tsp` salt
* `½ cup` butter, cut up
* `1 tsp` sugar
* `1 cup` water
* `1 ½ tsp` cornstarch

### Directions

1. Add corn to large sauce pan along with all ingredients except water and cornstarch.
2. Stir corn mixture over medium heat until butter is melted.
3. Combine water and cornstarch and stir until cornstarch is dissolved.
4. Slowly add water to corn in sauce pan, stirring constantly.
5. Reduce heat to simmer and stir until sauce thickens.
6. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until corn is tender, about 10 minutes.
