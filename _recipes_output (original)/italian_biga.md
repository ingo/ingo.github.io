Italian Biga, known as _biga_ in Italy, or _bighino_ when in small amounts, is a starter dough used in many classic regional breads. It gives strength to weak flours and produces a secondary fermentation which enhances the aroma, natural flavor, and special porosity of the final loaves and wheels of bread. Breads made with biga develop a wonderful taste due to their long risings which bring out the flavor of the grain. They also remain fresher and taste sweeter than those made with large amounts of commercial yeast.

### Ingredients

* `1/4 tsp` active dry yeast
* `60 ml` warm water
* `200 ml` water, preferably bottled spring water, at room temperature
* `330 g` unbleached all-purpose flour
* Vegetable oil, for the bowl

### Directions

1. Stir the yeast into the warm water and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. Stir the remaining water into the creamy yeast mixture, and then stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time. If mixing by hand, stir with a wooden spoon for 3 to â€¨4 minutes. If mixing with a stand mixer, beat with the paddle at the lowest speed for 2 minutes. If mixing with a food processor, mix just until a sticky dough forms.
3. Transfer the biga to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at cool room temperature for 6 to 24 hours, until the starter is triple its original volume but is still wet and sticky. 
4. Cover and refrigerate or freeze the biga until ready to use. When needed, scoop out the desired amount of biga for your recipe and proceed. It's recommended to weigh the biga rather than measuring it by volume since it expands at room temperature. If measuring by volume, measure chilled biga; if measuring by weight, the biga may be chilled or at room temperature.

### Notes

The first biga must come from somewhere, so you may make it following the instructions above. It freezes very well and needs only about 3 hours at room temperature until it is bubbly and active again, or it can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.
