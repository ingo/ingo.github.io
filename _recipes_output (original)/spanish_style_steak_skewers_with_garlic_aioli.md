* `2 lbs` marinated Tenderloin Tips
* `½` eggplant, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
* `1` red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces

### Directions

#### Marinade
1. To prepare the marinade, add all ingredients to a shallow glass, plastic bowl or plastic bag and whisk to mix. Add in Tenderloin Tips and marinate in the refrigerator, at least two hours or overnight.

#### Skewers
1. An hour before you’re ready to make your skewers, place wooden skewers in water and soak for at least one hour. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. To make skewers, thread the ingredients onto the skewers in the following order: beef, eggplant, red onion, beef, cherry tomato, red pepper and beef. Repeat to make all 12 skewers. Grill skewers over medium high-heat, about 2-3 minutes per side (5-6 minutes total) or until desired doneness is reached. Turn skewers at least once during grilling. Serve skewers with Garlic Aioli for dipping.

#### Garlic Aioli
1. Make aioli by mixing together mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Aioli may be made up to one day in advance.
