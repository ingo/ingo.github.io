This reduced-guilt fried chicken recipe is perfect for those who love fried chicken but want to keep their calorie intake in check. The chicken is marinated in a flavorful mixture before being coated in a spicy flour mixture and fried to golden perfection.

### Ingredients

#### Marinade

* `1 cup` buttermilk
* `2` teaspoons hot pepper sauce
* `1` garlic clove, minced
* `1` teaspoon dried thyme
* `1` teaspoon kosher salt
* Freshly cracked black pepper
* `4` 5-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/3-inch thickness

#### Assembly

* `1 cup` all-purpose flour
* `1` teaspoon kosher salt
* `1` teaspoon paprika
* `1` teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* `1` teaspoon cayenne pepper
* Vegetable oil (for frying)

### Directions

#### Marinade

1. Whisk first 5 ingredients in a medium bowl; season with pepper. Add chicken breasts to bowl; turn to coat. Cover and let marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

#### Assembly

1. Place a wire rack inside a baking sheet lined with paper towels; set aside. Whisk flour and next 4 ingredients in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold 1 chicken breast at a time. Remove 1 chicken breast from buttermilk mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Dredge in flour mixture, turning to coat evenly. Carefully place on prepared rack. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts. Let stand for 10 minutes. Carefully turn chicken over and sprinkle any moist parts with flour mixture.
2. Pour oil into a large heavy skillet to a depth of 1". Heat over medium-high heat until deep-fry thermometer registers 350°-360°. Carefully add chicken to oil. Fry, turning once, until chicken is golden brown and cooked through, 8-10 minutes total. Transfer chicken to a clean rack to drain.
