This recipe is a specialty of Gran Eléctrica in Brooklyn, New York, where chef David Goody serves aguachile with thinly sliced scallops that have been just cured in fresh lime juice.

### Ingredients

* `1 pound` sea scallops, sliced crosswise 1/4 inch thick 
* `3/4 cup` fresh lime juice 
* `1/2` pasilla chile
* `4 ounces` English cucumber, seeded and coarsely chopped, plus `1/4 cup` thinly minced cucumber 
* `1` small garlic clove, smashed 
* `1/4 cup` lightly packed cilantro 
* `1/4 cup` lightly packed parsley 
* `1 tablespoon` mint 
* `1/2 tablespoon` canola oil 
* `2 tablespoons` water 
* Kosher salt 
* `1/4 cup` thinly minced red onion 
* Tostadas or tortilla chips, for serving 

### Directions

Chef's tip: Scallops and Shrimp were poached at 125 degrees for 15 minutes in a water bath. Suggest reducing the time to 10 minutes.

1. In a glass bowl, toss the scallops with the lime juice. Cover and refrigerate for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the scallops just start to turn opaque.

2. Meanwhile, in a blender, combine the jalapeño with the chopped cucumber, garlic, cilantro, parsley, mint, oil and water and puree until very smooth. Season the aguachile with salt.

3. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the lime juice from the scallops. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of the aguachile to the scallops and mix well; reserve the remaining aguachile for another use. Fold in the onion and the thinly sliced cucumber and season with salt. Spoon into bowls or glasses and serve with tostadas or tortilla chips.
