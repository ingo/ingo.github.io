Making homemade dumpling wrappers is simple. This recipe yields about 35 to 40 dumpling wrappers that are 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 inches in diameter, which is a great size for potstickers. You can adjust the size of each dumpling wrapper to your liking.

### Ingredients

* `2 1/4 cups` (320g) all-purpose flour
* `3/4 cup` (175g) very warm water (between 110 to 120ºF)

### Directions

1. Pour all the flour and water into a mixing bowl. Use chopsticks or a wooden spoon to stir everything together. Mix until all the water is absorbed and shaggy pieces of dough start to form.
2. Use your hands to gather the dough together. As you do this, dig into the dough with your fingers in a claw-like motion. This helps to distribute the moisture inside the dough.
3. Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it on a surface for 2 to 3 minutes. The dough is slightly tacky, but not sticky. You shouldn’t need to flour the surface. If you find the dough is sticky, dust the surface with a little bit of flour and knead the flour into the dough.
4. After several minutes of kneading, you should get a pretty smooth ball of dough. There may be some crags and dimples on the surface, but that’s okay. Place the dough into the bowl again, and cover the bowl with a damp towel or a silicone lid. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
5. Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it again a few times. Shape the dough into a ball. The surface should look incredibly smooth after this second kneading. Place the dough into the bowl, cover it, and let it rest again for at least 30 minutes.
6. After the dough has rested for the second time, you are ready to roll it out. Lightly dust your work surface with flour.
7. Take the dough out of the bowl. Make a hole in the center of the dough with your finger. Then use your fingers to stretch out that hole in the center. Keep stretching out the dough and rotating it until you get a large ring.
8. Cut the dough with a bench scraper or a knife. You should now have a thick dough rope. Keep rolling out the rope until it is about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.
9. Now, cut out 5 small pieces of dough, each weighing about 12 to 13 grams. This is about 1 tablespoon of dough. The dough dries out easily so put the dough rope back into the bowl and cover it again.
10. Take each piece of dough and roll it into a ball. Using the fleshy part of your palm, flatten each ball of dough into a disc, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Lightly dust each disc with flour.
11. Take your rolling pin into your right hand and roll it over the entire surface of the disc and then roll it off. Your rolling pin never leaves the surface. Use your left and to rotate the disc 90 degrees and roll over the entire surface again. Repeat this two more times until you have rolled out the dough for two revolutions. If the disc is sticking to the rolling pin, brush it with some flour.
12. The third time around the wrapper, you will only roll over the wrapper halfway before rotating it. This ensures that the center is slightly thicker than the edges so the filling is doesn’t break through the wrapper easily. Do this for 1 to 2 revolutions around the wrapper.
13. For the final revolution, you will only roll over the edges of the dough (about 1/2 inch into the wrapper). The wrapper should be somewhere between 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Brush some flour over the wrapper, set it aside, and cover it with a dry towel. Roll out the 4 remaining discs. Once you’ve rolled out 5 wrappers completely, use it to make dumplings.
14. The dumpling wrappers form a crust easily. If you are working by yourself, you don’t want to roll out more than 5 dumpling wrappers at a time.
15. If you want to store the wrappers for later use, roll out the dough. Brush potato starch (or tapioca starch) over all the wrappers before stacking them up. Tightly wrap the stack of wrappers with plastic wrap. Then, transfer them into an air-tight container. You can refrigerate these for up to 2 days or freeze them for up to a month, as long as no freezer burn develops around the wrappers.

### Notes

1. You can microwave the water on high for 45 seconds and check to see if it has reached the appropriate temperature. If the water is not hot enough, continue microwaving at 10-second intervals.
2. Stand mixer directions: Add the flour and water to the bowl and mix on low speed with the dough hook attachment. Once all the water has been incorporated into the flour, increase the speed to medium-low. Continue mixing for about 2 minutes, until a dough forms and all the loose flour has been gathered into the dough. Turn off the stand mixer and transfer the dough onto a surface. Knead it by hand a few times, then shape into a ball. Place the dough ball back into the mixing bowl and cover it with a damp towel or a silicone lid.
3. If you don’t have time to roll out all the dough into wrappers, you can refrigerate the dough overnight. However, it is very difficult to roll out the dough when it is still cold. Let the dough sit on the counter and reach room temperature before rolling it out.
