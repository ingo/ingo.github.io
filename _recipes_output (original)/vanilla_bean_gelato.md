This recipe for Vanilla Bean Gelato is a labor of love, but the results are worth it. The gelato is rich and creamy, with a strong vanilla flavor that comes from using fresh vanilla beans. The recipe also includes detailed instructions for pasteurizing the mix and achieving the perfect texture. 

### Ingredients

* Cream
* Milk
* `Sugar`
* Skimmed milk powder
* [Inulin](https://amzn.to/2DglNyU)
* Egg yolks
* `1` large grade A (or ‘black’) [Bourbon vanilla bean](https://amzn.to/2Dfty7Z).

### Directions

1. Fill a large bowl with cubes of ice. Place a zip-lock bag next to the bowl ready for later.
2. Run a sharp knife down the vanilla pod to separate it into two. Scrape out the sticky material containing the small black beans into a small bowl. Dice the two vanilla pod halves into small pieces or, preferably, grind in a coffee or spice grinder. Add to the bowl containing the sticky material and set aside for later.
3. Before you combine your ingredients, weigh your pan and note down its weight. 
4. In your pan, combine the sugar and egg yolks. Add the cream, milk, skimmed milk powder, and inulin. Stir well.
5. Over a medium heat, bring your mix up to 75°C (167°F) whilst constantly stirring; this usually takes me between 13 and 15 minutes.
6. Once the temperature reaches 75°C (167°F), turn the heat down to low, move your pan about 1/4 of the way off the heat, and continue heating and stirring until the temperature slowly reaches 77
