This recipe is an homage to the traditional concha bread I grew up eating in Mexico. It keeps all the delicious orange blossom and vanilla flavors but uses them in a cookie. The crust is a vanilla craquelin, the same recipe I use for the bread and my favorite part of this pastry. The smell coming out of the oven when you bake them is like being in Mexico again.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` all-purpose flour (for the crust)
* `2/3 cup` granulated sugar (for the crust)
* `1/3 cup` vegetable shortening (for the crust, may substitute softened unsalted butter)
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract (for the crust)
* `1-2 drops` pink gel food coloring (for the crust, optional; may use other color of your choice)
* `2 1/3 cups` cake flour, plus more as needed (for the cookies)
* `1/2 tsp` baking powder (for the cookies)
* `1/4 tsp` fine salt (for the cookies)
* `11 tbsp` unsalted butter, softened (for the cookies)
* `3/4 cup` granulated sugar (for the cookies)
* `1` large egg, at room temperature (for the cookies)
* `1 tsp` orange blossom water (for the cookies)
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract (for the cookies)
* `1 tsp` finely grated zest of 1 orange (for the cookies)

### Directions

1. Make the crust: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or using a large bowl and a hand mixer, beat together the all-purpose flour, sugar, shortening and vanilla on medium speed until a soft dough forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix again on medium until evenly distributed. 
2. Make the cookies: In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder and salt until thoroughly combined.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or using a large bowl and a hand mixer, beat together the butter and sugar on medium until smooth, creamy and somewhat fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg and beat again on medium until combined, followed by the orange blossom water, vanilla and orange zest, and mix again until incorporated; scrape down the bowl.
4. Add the flour mixture to the bowl and mix on medium-low until a soft dough forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.
5. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
6. Use your hands to pull off heaping 1-tablespoon portions of dough and roll them into smooth balls about 1 inch wide, setting them about 2 inches apart on the prepared sheets. Using your palm, gently press to flatten until they are a little less than 2 inches wide.
7. Pull off 2-teaspoon portions of the crust mixture and roll into smooth balls. Press between your hands and flatten into something like a small tortilla, placing each portion on top of the individual dough balls. Aim to have the crust portions slightly wider than the cookie balls so that when placed on top, they drape over the sides somewhat.
8. In a bowl or in a little pile on the counter, dip the concha cutter in a few tablespoons of cake flour. Use the cutter to press the seashell pattern on top of the dough balls. Press just hard enough to flatten the cookies a bit more and leave an imprint on the surface. Don’t cut all the way down. Be sure to dust the cutter before you press each dough ball.
9. Bake the two sheets for 9 to 12 minutes, just until the edges of the cookies start drying, rotating from top to bottom and front to back halfway through. You don’t want to add much color to the cookies. Let the cookies rest on the pan for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Notes

* The prepped dough balls can be frozen for up to 2 months. After you have shaped and pressed them with the cutter, transfer them on a baking sheet to the freezer. Once they’re solid, pack into an airtight container or bag and freeze until ready to use. Bake straight from the freezer, adding 1 to 3 minutes of bake time.
* The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks or frozen for up to 2 months. The crust is very delicate, so make sure there’s enough room or cushioning in between the cookies.
* Orange blossom water can be found at Middle Eastern and other international markets, or online.
