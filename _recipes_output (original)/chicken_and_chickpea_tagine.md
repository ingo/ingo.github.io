Like many dishes that rely on a combination of spices, a tagine, which is a slowly braised Moroccan stew, may look more intimidating to cook than it is. Even with shortcuts, the results are exotic in flavor and appearance. My version may not compare to those that begin with toasting and grinding spices and peeling grapes, but it is easily executed and still divine. 

### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` corn or canola oil
* `2 tbsp` butter
* `1` large onion, peeled and thinly sliced
* `2 cloves` garlic, minced
* `Pinch` salt
* `Pinch` nutmeg
* `1/2 tsp` ground cinnamon
* `1 tsp` ground ginger
* `1 tsp` ground cumin
* `1 tsp` ground coriander
* `1/2 tsp` ground black pepper
* `Pinch` cayenne
* `1 1/2 to 2 cups` chopped tomatoes (canned are fine; drain excess liquid)
* `4 cups` chickpeas (canned are fine; drain and rinse first)
* `1/2 cup` raisins or chopped pitted dates
* `1/2` vanilla bean
* `8` chicken thighs, or 4 leg-thigh pieces, cut in two
* Chopped cilantro or parsley leaves

### Directions

1. Put oil and butter in a large skillet or casserole, which can be covered later, and turn heat to medium high. When butter melts, add onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until it softens, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, a large pinch of salt and spices. Cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, chickpeas, raisins and vanilla, and bring to a boil. (If mixture is very dry, add about `1/2 cup` water.) Taste, and add salt as necessary.

2. Sprinkle chicken pieces with salt, and nestle them into sauce. Cover, and 5 minutes later adjust heat so mixture simmers steadily. Cook until chicken is very tender, 45 minutes to an hour. Taste, and adjust seasoning. Then garnish, and serve.
