title: Root Beer Rickey
category: Beverages
description: Spicy, spritzy and refreshing, this cocktail is essentially grown-up root beer. A classic rickey is just liquor, lime juice and carbonated water, but reach for rye whiskey and trade the soda water for root beer, and you get the root beer rickey, a drink bartender Jim Meehan created for Cicoria, a pizzeria in Portland, Ore. Root beer and rye are natural partners, as each is woodsy, minty and caramelly; the soda also lends sweetness without having to add sugar.

### Ingredients

* `Ice`
* `2 ounces` rye whiskey
* `1 ounce` fresh lime juice (from 1 lime)
* `4 ounces` root beer (see Tip)
* Lime wedge, for serving (optional)

### Directions

1. Into an ice-filled Collins glass, pour the whiskey and lime juice. Top with root beer, then give a quick stir with a bar spoon, fork handle or chopstick. Top with the lime wedge, if using.

### Notes

* The flavor of the drink is largely dependent on the quality of the root beer, so it’s worth seeking out a root beer sweetened with honey, molasses or cane sugar as opposed to high-fructose corn syrup. Virgil’s and Jones Soda are great choices; Cicoria uses root beer from Crater Lake Soda.
