title: Rice Cake Soup With Bok Choy and Edamame
category: Soups
description: This fresh soup is a riff on something that a Chinese or Korean mom might make, with rice cakes added to bulk it up. They are precooked, but will rehydrate and soak up more liquid in this soup. If you find that they have soaked up too much, simply add a little more broth or water to thin out the soup.

### Ingredients

* `Â¼ cup` vegetable oil
* `2` medium leeks, trimmed, white and light green parts cut into 1/4\-inch rounds
* `1 bunch` scallions \(about 6\), whites and greens separated, thinly sliced
* `1 (1\-inch)` piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* `4 cups` chicken stock
* `2` medium heads baby bok choy \(about 8 ounces\), trimmed, stems and leaves divided, stems cut into bite\-size pieces
* `2 cups` fresh or frozen rice cakes \(about 10 ounces\)
* `1 cup` frozen shelled edamame
* `2` large eggs, lightly beaten
* `1 tablespoon` apple cider vinegar

### Directions

1. In a pot, heat oil over medium\-high. Add leeks, scallion whites and ginger, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden at the edges and softened, 7 to 8 minutes.
2. Add chicken stock and bok choy stems, and bring to a boil over high. Reduce the heat and simmer and cook until the broth is flavorful, about 10 minutes. Add rice cakes and simmer until plump, about 8 minutes.
3. Add edamame and bok choy leaves and stir until bright green, about 1 minute. Swirl in the beaten eggs in a slow, steady stream, stirring gently to make sure the eggs form long ribbons. Stir in the vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and top with remaining scallion greens.

### Notes

Substituting one to two cups of cooked rice to the soup in place of the rice cakes works well if you don't have access to an Asian grocery store.
