This recipe is a delightful twist on the classic waffle recipe from the renowned cookbook, "The Joy of Cooking". The addition of vanilla gives these waffles a sweet aroma and a hint of extra flavor that makes them truly irresistible.

### Ingredients

* `1 3/4 cups` cake flour (1/2 whole wheat)
* `2 tsp` baking powder
* `1/4 tsp` salt
* `1 tbsp` sugar
* `3` egg yolks
* `2 to 7 tablespoons` melted butter or oil
* `1 1/2 cups` milk
* `1 tsp` vanilla
* `3` egg whites

### Directions

1. Use all-purpose flour, but sift or whisk it before measuring. 
2. Combine all dry ingredients and re-sift or whisk. 
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and add the butter (use 3 tablespoons for a more crisp waffle), milk, and vanilla. 
4. Combine with a few swift strokes. The batter will be slightly lumpy, like muffin batter. 
5. If you want to add anything like nuts or chocolate chips to the batter, now's the time. 1/2 cup is about right for most additions. 
6. Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry. Fold them into the batter until barely blended. 
7. Cook according to your waffle maker's instructions. On most waffle makers, that's about three minutes, or until steam stops coming out. 
8. If you're holding your waffles instead of eating them right out of the waffle maker and want to keep them crisp, warm your oven to 200°F and put the waffles on wire racks instead of a tray or plate.

### Notes

The vanilla is an addition to the original recipe and can be omitted if preferred. The more oil or butter used, the crispier the waffles will be.
