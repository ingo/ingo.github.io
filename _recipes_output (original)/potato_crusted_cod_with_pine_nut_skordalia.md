This traditional Greek dish is usually enjoyed during the Feast of the Annunciation. The contrast of succulent cod fish with a crusty potato crust is striking. The pine nut Skordalia is the garlicky “icing” on the cod.

### Ingredients

**For the Pine Nut Skordalia**
* `4 slices` of stale bread
* `4 cloves` of garlic, smashed
* `1/2 tsp` coarse sea salt
* `1 1/2 tsp` white vinegar
* `1/2 cup` of pine nuts
* `1/2 cup` olive oil
* `1/2 cup` sunflower oil

**For the Cod**
* `4` cod fillets, boneless/skinless
* `approx. 2 tsp` sea salt
* `1/2 tsp` black pepper
* `zest of 1/2` lemon
* `1` Russet/baking potato
* `1` egg

### Directions

1. To make the Skordalia, soak the stale bread in water then use all the might of your hands to squeeze it free of excess water. Now place in a mortar with the smashed garlic, some coarse sea salt and the wine vinegar. Now pound the mixture into a paste with your pestle then add the pine nuts and pound into the paste.
2. Now pound and swirl the pestle into the mixture while adding the oil in increments. Keep adding oil when the previous amount has been absorbed. Adjust seasoning with salt, vinegar and reserve.
3. Rub your fish with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, lemon zest, set aside.
4. Peel your potato and use the side of a box grater with the large holes to grate. Place the grated potato in a tea towel, gather up the edges to make a pouch and twist with your hands to squeeze out excess liquid.
5. Transfer grated potato to a bowl along with one cracked egg, salt, pepper and toss to coat.
6. Spread a thin layer of potato topping on each fillet.
7. Heat a large skillet to medium-high heat. Cut some parchment paper into squares that are 1 1/2 times large than the fillet’s surface and place each on top of the potatoes. Add a little oil into the pan and place the fish parchment side down and brown for 2-3 minutes.
8. Carefully remove the fish from the pan and invert (parchment side up). Allow to cool and remove and discard the parchment (you should have nicely browned potato scales on the fish). Finish in a preheated 425F oven for 10-12 minutes or until fish is opaque.
9. Spoon Skordalia on your plate, place some steamed asparagus on top, then the cod and garnish of your choice.

### Notes

**Top Tip:** If you wish to use a food processor, place the bread the processor along with the garlic, pine nuts and vinegar. Run on high until smooth, then pour a slow and stead stream of oil. Add salt to taste.

**Note:** Try blanched white almonds instead for your skordalia.
