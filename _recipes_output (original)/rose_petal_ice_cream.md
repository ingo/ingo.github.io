Rose petals are indeed edible but one must ensure the petals haven’t been sprayed with any pesticides before using. If you don’t have roses in your garden, ask your florist. This recipe takes the route of "no-churn" ice creams. I scream, you scream, we all scream for rose petal ice cream!

### Ingredients

* `2 cups` cold heavy cream
* `1 can` condensed milk (or `1 cup` powdered sugar)
* `1 tbsp` granulated sugar
* `12` large red rose petals (untreated/unsprayed)
* `1 tsp` coloured rosewater or pomegranate mollases (for colour)
* `1 shot` of vodka

### Directions

1. Into the bowl of your stand mixer, add the cream, condensed milk (or sugar) and attach the whisk and whip to soft peaks.
2. Meanwhile, add the sugar and rose petals into a food processor and pulse until a puree.
3. Turn down the speed and add the rose petal puree, rosewater and vodka and mix for a couple of minutes or until well incorporated.
4. Empty into a container, place plastic wrap on top of the ice cream and place the lid on. Place in your freezer for minimum 5 hours to overnight.

### Notes

Alcohol in ice cream is added to give you a softer texture when it is taken out of the freezer. You can omit if you like.
