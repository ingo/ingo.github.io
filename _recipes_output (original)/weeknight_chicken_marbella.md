description: A no-marinade-needed Marbella that gets the job done in under an hour. Chicken thighs are seared hard until deep golden brown to render the fat, which also helps amp up the chicken flavor. This version is also significantly less sweet than the original, but if you like your brown sugar, use 1/3 cup instead. The reduced pan sauce is easy to love, so be sure to serve with a loaf of crusty bread to mop it all up.

### Ingredients

* `1 tbsp` extra-virgin olive oil
* `6` bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds)
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* `5` garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* `½ cup` pitted prunes
* `½ cup` pitted Spanish green olives
* `¼ cup` drained capers, plus `1 tbsp` caper brine
* `3` fresh or dried bay leaves
* `2 tbsp` fresh oregano, chopped, or `1 tbsp` dried oregano
* `2 tbsp` dark brown sugar
* `1 cup` dry white wine
* `¼ cup` red wine vinegar

### Directions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high until shimmering and tiny wisps of smoke are visible, about 2 minutes. Add chicken, skin-side down, cover and cook until deep golden brown, about 10 minutes. (Covering the chicken speeds up the cook time and prevents the oil from splattering all over your stovetop.) Flip chicken, cover again and cook until golden on second side, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.
2. Arrange prunes, olives, capers and brine, bay leaves and oregano in between chicken pieces. Sprinkle with brown sugar, 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; pour wine and vinegar over top and bring to a boil. Reduce to low, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Transfer chicken to a serving platter and return pan to high heat. Cook sauce, swirling occasionally, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Spoon pan sauce over chicken and serve.
