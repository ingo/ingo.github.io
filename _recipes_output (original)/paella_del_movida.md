### Ingredients

* `1.5 kg` farmed white rabbit
* `6` garlic cloves, unpeeled
* `3` rosemary sprigs
* `1.5 litres` olive oil
* `200 g` mussels
* `12` raw king prawns (shrimp)
* `60 ml` extra virgin olive oil
* pinch of saffron threads
* `1 tbsp` thyme leaves, chopped
* `1 tsp` chopped rosemary
* `2` garlic cloves, extra, finely chopped
* `400 g` Calasparra rice
* `250 g` sofrito
* `125 ml` dry white wine
* `1.25 litres` hot fish stock
* `600 g` periwinkles or snails, rinsed (optional)
* `200 g` firm-fleshed fish such as marlin, swordfish or tuna, cut into 2.5 cm pieces
* `100 g` cleaned squid, cut into 5 mm strips
* `185 g` green beans, broad (fava) beans or peas (optional)
* `2 tbsp` chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, to garnish
* `2` lemons, halved

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 140°C (275°F/Gas 1).
2. Cut the rabbit into 12 pieces — cut the hind legs into two pieces, leave the front legs of the rabbit whole and leave the saddles attached at the backbone, but cut in a cross section into six pieces.
3. Confit the rabbit by laying the pieces flat in a deep roasting tin, which is just large enough to comfortably fit the rabbit pieces in a single layer. Lay the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs on top. Cover with the olive oil. You may need more or less oil, depending on your roasting tin. Bake slowly for 2½–3 hours. Cooking time will depend on the rabbit (farmed rabbit will cook faster than wild rabbit). The rabbit is done when the flesh comes away easily from the bone. Remove the rabbit from the oil and drain on paper towel.
4. Scrub the mussels and pull out the hairy beards. Rinse well and drain. Discard any broken mussels, or open ones that don’t close when tapped on the bench. Cover with a damp cloth and refrigerate until ready to use. Make a shallow cut with a very sharp small knife along the length of each prawn back. Remove and discard the dark vein and shell, leaving on the head and tail.
5. To make the paella, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a 34 cm (13½ inch) paella pan or large, deep, heavy-based frying pan over medium heat. Add the saffron, thyme, rosemary and chopped garlic, and stir for 1 minute to release the flavour from the herbs and spices. Add the rice and season with two pinches of salt. Stir thoroughly to coat the rice and cook for a few minutes until the rice is slightly translucent around the edges. Add the sofrito and stir it through the rice. Cook for a minute or so to allow the flavours to meld. Add the wine and stir it through for a brief moment. Next add the hot fish stock and stir through. Increase the heat to medium–high and bring to the boil.
6. From this point onwards, do not stir the paella, as the socorat (crust) needs to form on the bottom of the pan. If the flame or element doesn’t cover the base of the pan, move the pan around during cooking to allow the paella to cook evenly.
7. Once the paella is boiling add the rabbit, placing the pieces evenly around the pan. After 3 minutes add the periwinkles, if using, in between the pieces of rabbit. After another 5 minutes place the fish pieces and squid on top of the rice.
8. By now the rice will have expanded a little so reduce the heat to medium. Continue to move the pan around during cooking to allow the paella to cook evenly.
9. When the majority of the stock has been absorbed and small holes appear between the rice (this will take about 10 minutes), place the prawns on top and allow the escaping steam to gently cook them. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the prawns are just pink then turn to cook the other side. Add the broad beans or peas, if using. After 5 minutes, remove from the heat and cover the pan with foil so that any remaining stock is absorbed and the rice separates a little.
10. Meanwhile, quickly cook the mussels by bringing 100 ml (3½ fl oz) water to the boil in a shallow saucepan. Add the mussels, cover and bring the water back to the boil. Cook for 3–4 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard any unopened mussels. Drain well and place on top of the paella. Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve with lemon wedges.
