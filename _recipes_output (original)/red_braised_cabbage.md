This recipe is a family favorite, passed down from my grandmother. The combination of tart apple, sweet brown sugar, and hearty red cabbage creates a side dish that's both flavorful and satisfying.

### Ingredients

* `2 tbsp` butter
* `1` yellow onion, sliced with the grain
* `1/2` large or `1` small red cabbage, quartered, thinly sliced (core removed)
* `1` tart apple, peeled and grated
* `1 tbsp` brown sugar
* `1/4 cup` red wine
* `1/4 cup` apple cider vinegar, plus a splash
* `1/4 cup` water
* Salt and freshly ground pepper

### Directions

1. In a medium pot or Dutch oven, cook the onions in the butter over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the cabbage and cook, stirring, for a few minutes.
3. Add the apple, brown sugar, wine, vinegar, and water, and bring up to a simmer, stirring.
4. Cover and braise for 30 minutes, stirring once and checking on the texture. Cook a little less for a firmer cabbage; a little more for softer cabbage.
5. Add a small splash of cider vinegar just before serving.
