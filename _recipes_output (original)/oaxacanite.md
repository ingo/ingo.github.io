description: A delightful cocktail with strong chocolate notes and a nice underlying agave spirit warmth. The smoke from the mezcal doesn't dominate, but rather complements the other flavors.

This cocktail was created by Ben Long at the John Dory Oyster Bar in Manhattan and was first published in Sasha Petraskeâ€™s book, _Regarding Cocktails_. It's a favorite at the Library of Distilled Spirits in New York. The pith of the grapefruit peel acts as the bittering agent, and shaking it well releases essential oils that create a balanced drink.

### Ingredients

* `1 oz` Mescal
* `1 oz` Blanco Tequila
* `0.75 oz` Lime Juice
* `0.75 oz` Honey Syrup
* `2 dashes` Angostura Bitters
* `1` 2 inch Grapefruit Twist

### Directions

1. Add all ingredients to a shaker, shake and strain.
2. Garnish with the grapefruit twist.

### Notes

Make sure to shake with the grapefruit peel. The pith of the peel here is actually acting as the bittering agent. Shaking the hell out of it releases oils and is essential for creating a balanced drink.
