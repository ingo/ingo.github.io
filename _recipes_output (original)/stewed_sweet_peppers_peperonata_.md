This sweet, simple pepper stew is an ideal use for summer's bounty of sweet peppers. It makes a great antipasto atop bruschetta. It's a recipe that has been passed down through generations and is a staple in many Italian households.

### Ingredients

* `⅓ cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `4` assorted red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into ¼" strips
* `4` cloves garlic, thinly sliced crosswise
* `½` medium white onion, thinly sliced
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* `3 tbsp.` red wine vinegar
* `½ cup` water

### Directions

1. Heat oil in a 4-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat. 
2. Add peppers, garlic, onions, and ½ cup water and season with salt and pepper. 
3. Cook, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until peppers are soft, about 1 hour. 
4. Stir in vinegar and transfer to a serving bowl.

### Notes

The peppers turn out very sweet and mellow, but be careful with the vinegar. Some people find that 2 tablespoons is enough, while others prefer the full 3 tablespoons. Adjust according to your taste.
