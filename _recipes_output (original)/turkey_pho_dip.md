This recipe is a creative take on the classic French dip, using the turkey carcass to make a flavorful pho broth. It's a great way to use up leftover turkey from the holidays!

### Ingredients

* `1` turkey carcass
* `1 bunch` scallions, coarsely chopped
* `1 2-inch piece` ginger, peeled, sliced
* `3` star anise pods
* `1 2-inch` cinnamon stick
* `1/4 cup` fish sauce
* `3 tbsp` sugar
* `2 tbsp` coriander seeds
* `2 tbsp` fennel seeds
* Kosher salt (optional)
* `1/2 cup` mayonnaise
* `3 tbsp` hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek)
* Leftover turkey
* `4` ciabatta or other sturdy sandwich rolls, toasted
* `2 tbsp` hoisin sauce
* Tender herb leaves (such as cilantro, Thai basil, and/or sweet basil), sliced scallions, mung bean sprouts, lime wedges, and sliced jalapeños (for serving)

### Directions

1. Bring turkey carcass, scallions, ginger, star anise, cinnamon, fish sauce, sugar, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and 4 qt. water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat, skim surface, and simmer until liquid is reduced by nearly half, 2–2 1/2 hours.
2. Strain broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan; taste and adjust seasoning with salt if needed.
3. Whisk mayonnaise and chili paste in a small bowl to combine. (If you like it extra-spicy, add more chili paste.)
4. Heat leftover turkey in 1 cup pho broth in a medium skillet until warmed through.
5. Assemble sandwiches with rolls, spicy mayonnaise, hoisin sauce, herbs, scallions, and bean sprouts. Serve with lime wedges and jalapeños alongside, as well as a small bowl of warm broth for dipping.

### Notes

* Cooks' Note: If you like it extra-spicy, add more chili paste.
