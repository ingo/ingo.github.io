This meatball mixture can be made ahead and left to marinate in the fridge for 3 hours or even overnight. Use ground beef that is 85 percent lean meat, 15 percent fat, or 80 percent lean and 20 percent fat for juicier meatballs. The Ritz crackers here make for a more tender meatball, but feel free to substitute plain dry bread crumbs. The meatballs are tasty on their own, but for a simple dipping sauce, combine 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar. Serve over steamed rice with kimchi, or as a sandwich with mayonnaise or marinara sauce.

### Ingredients

* `½ cup` chopped scallions
* `2 tbsp` low-sodium soy sauce
* `2 tbsp` minced garlic
* `1 tsp` kosher salt
* `1 tsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `½ cup` finely crushed Ritz crackers (12 crackers)
* `1 lb` ground beef (round or chuck)

### Directions

1. Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients and use your hands to gently mix.
2. Shape the meat into 12 golf-ball-size rounds (about 2 inches in diameter), and arrange on a greased rimmed baking sheet.
3. Bake until golden and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.

### Notes

* Leftover meatballs freeze well and can be reheated in the oven at 375 degrees until warmed through (about 20 minutes).
* To make the Ritz crumbs, place the crackers in a resealable plastic bag and lightly crush them with the back of a wooden spoon or measuring cup.
