Tako Poke does not mean to jab with a Mexican-style sandwich made of tortillas. Tako is the Japanese word for octopus, and tako poke (pronounced POE-keh) refers to a Hawaiian delicacy made of octopus and condiments of limu (seaweed), Hawaiian sea salt, chiles and 'inamona (roasted kukui nut paste). 

### Ingredients

#### Tako Poke
* `1 pound` tako (octopus)
* `1` ripe medium-size tomato, chopped
* `1 cup` chopped cucumber
* `½ cup` chopped onion
* `3 tbsp` soy sauce
* `1 tsp` sesame oil
* `1` Hawaiian red chile pepper, seeded and minced (or `½ tsp` red chile pepper flakes)

#### Korean-Style Tako Poke
* `2 pounds` fresh ogo (edible seaweed)
* `1 pound` tako (octopus)
* `1` Maui onion, diced
* `½ cup` chopped green onion
* `1 cup` rice vinegar
* `½ cup` soy sauce
* `½ cup` sugar
* `3 tbsp` roasted sesame seeds
* `2 tbsp` bottled Korean kochu jang (hot chile paste)
* `1 tsp` minced fresh ginger
* `2` cloves garlic, minced

#### Oki's Tahitian-Style Tako Poke
* `1 pound` tako (octopus)
* `½ cup` water
* `1 can (12 ounces)` coconut milk
* `3 slices` fresh ginger (each ¼ inch thick)
* `2 cups` cucumber, cut in about 5/16-inch dice
* `½ cup` Maui onion, sliced
* `½ cup` green onion, chopped
* `¼ cup` ogo, chopped
* `2 tsp` kukui nut oil
* `½ tbsp` Hawaiian salt
* `1 tsp` dried chile pepper flakes or to taste, optional

### Directions

#### Tako Poke
1. To clean fresh octopus, turn head inside out and remove ink sac, innards and mouthparts; rinse. To tenderize fresh octopus, freeze, pound or lomi (massage).
2. To cook octopus, in a medium pot, bring enough water to cover octopus to a boil. Lower octopus into boiling water, return water to a rolling boil, then cook 2 or 3 minutes. Drain, plunge into cold water and slice into thin slices. 
3. In a bowl, combine all ingredients and mix well.

#### Korean-Style Tako Poke
1. Cut ogo in 2-inch lengths. Cook tako and slice. 
2. In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients. 
3. Serve very cold at tailgate and backyard barbecues.

#### Oki's Tahitian-Style Tako Poke
1. Bring tako, the ½ cup water, coconut milk and ginger to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes or until of desired firmness.
2. Discard coconut/ginger liquid. Slice tako into bite-size pieces and cool a few minutes. 
3. Add remaining ingredients. 

### Notes

For a more traditional poke: Omit coconut milk, and add 1 or 2 teaspoons sesame oil or to taste.
