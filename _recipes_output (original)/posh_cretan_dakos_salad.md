This Posh Cretan Dakos Salad is a refined version of the traditional Cretan Dakos Salad. Perfect for dinner parties, it presents a more formal look to your dishes. The base is a round Cretan rusk, topped with a mix of ripe tomato and finished with a fresh tart cheese. It's a delightful and refreshing dish for a hot summer day.

### Ingredients

* `3/4 cup` crumbled Cretan barley rusk
* `3/4 cup` diced ripe tomato
* `2 tbsp` diced red onion
* `1 tsp` capers
* Sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
* `1 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil
* `1/2 tsp` dried Greek oregano
* `1/4 cup` strained Greek yogurt
* `1/4 cup` crumbled Feta cheese
* `2 tbsp` milk

**Garnishes**
* Kalamata olive
* Capers
* Dried Greek oregano
* Extra-virgin olive oil

### Directions

1. Briefly run the rusk pieces under some water and crumble with your hands into a bowl. Set aside.
2. Into another bowl, add your diced tomatoes, onion, capers, salt, pepper, olive oil and oregano and mix with a spoon. Set aside.
3. In another bowl, mix the yogurt, Feta and milk with a spoon.
4. Place a ring mould on a plate and place the crumbled rusks in the bottom and press down with a spoon to flatten and even out.
5. Top with tomato mixture, even out with a spoon and then top with Feta mixture and again, smooth out.
6. Garnish with olive, capers, drizzle more olive oil and sprinkle with oregano and serve.

### Notes

* Donâ€™t have a fancy ring mould? Find a plastic container like a yogurt or sour cream tub of similar diameter and cut the bottom off to make your own mould.
* Also, if you have a ramekin of similar dimension, assemble the tartare in reverse order (rusks on top) and place a plate on top, invert and unmould.
