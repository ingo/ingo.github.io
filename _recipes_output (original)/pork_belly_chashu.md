This recipe is an extract from the book "Ivan Ramen" by Ivan Orkin, a renowned chef known for his innovative approach to traditional ramen. The recipe is a classic Japanese dish, Pork Belly Chashu, which is often used as a topping for ramen but can also be enjoyed as a standalone main course.

### Ingredients

* `25ml` sake
* `25ml` mirin
* `10g` garlic, chopped coarsely
* `15g` fresh ginger, peeled and chopped coarsely
* `135ml` dark soy sauce
* `75ml` light soy sauce
* `15g` caster sugar
* `1kg` piece of pork belly
* Water

### Directions

1. Measure the sake and mirin into a saucepan and heat it to a light simmer over medium heat. Cook for 3 minutes to burn off some of the alcohol.
2. Add the garlic, ginger and two soy sauces to the pan and bring the mixture back to a simmer over medium heat. Add the sugar and stir until it dissolves. Continue cooking, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. Leave the mixture to sit for at least an hour to allow the flavours to meld.
3. Remove the meat from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to allow it to come closer to room temperature. Completely cold meat cooks more slowly, and you’ll risk drying out the exterior before the interior cooks.
4. Cut the pork belly in half across the grain and put it in a pot that will hold it snugly. Pour in the cooled chashu tare, then add enough water to just cover the pork by about 1cm.
5. Over high heat, bring the liquid up to a full boil. Skim off any scum that comes to the surface. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, covered, for 2½ to 4 hours until the meat is tender enough to be easily pulled apart with a fork.
6. When the meat is tender, remove it from the pot and set it on a tray to cool. Reserve the cooking liquid for future braises or for the eggs; it will keep for a week in the fridge or you can freeze it for 2 months.
7. Once the meat has cooled down to room temperature, refrigerate it until it’s completely chilled, or up to 5 days. It’s important to chill the belly thoroughly before slicing it, or you’ll end up with pulled pork. Once it’s cooled, slice the belly into strips across the grain, then into pieces of the desired thickness. You can reheat the pork and use it however you see fit.

### Notes

The cooking time for the pork belly may vary depending on the source of your meat. Mass-produced pork belly usually takes longer to cook than small farm-produced pork belly. Also, remember to chill the belly thoroughly before slicing to maintain its texture.
