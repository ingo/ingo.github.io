This Shiso Sorbet recipe is a unique dessert that brings the flavors of Tokyo to your kitchen. It's a part of the Tokyo Cult Recipes collection, which aims to introduce the world to the diverse and exciting culinary culture of Japan's capital city.

### Ingredients

* `1 cup` sugar
* `1 cup` water
* `1 cup` shiso leaves
* `1 tbsp` lemon juice

### Directions

1. Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar is completely dissolved.
2. Add the shiso leaves to the saucepan and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
3. Remove the saucepan from heat and let it cool. Once cooled, strain the mixture to remove the shiso leaves.
4. Stir in the lemon juice.
5. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.
6. Once churned, transfer the sorbet to a container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.

### Notes

The shiso leaves give this sorbet a unique flavor that's both refreshing and intriguing. If you can't find shiso leaves, you can substitute with mint leaves for a different but equally delicious sorbet.
