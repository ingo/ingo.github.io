This slow-braised lamb shanks recipe by Mark Bittman is a versatile dish that can be incorporated into a variety of meals. The lamb is cooked until it's falling off the bone, and the cooking liquid is reserved for use in other recipes.

### Ingredients

* `2` lamb shanks, about 1 pound each
* `2 tbsp` olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* `½ cup` good white wine or stock

### Directions

1. In a large skillet, brown shanks well in oil; this will take as long as half an hour (you can cover the pan to avoid spattering). Sprinkle with salt and pepper as they cook.
2. Lower the heat, pour off the excess fat, add the wine or stock. Simmer over low heat for 1½ to 2 hours, covered, turning and adding water, about ¼ cup at a time, as necessary, until the meat is falling off the bone.
3. Cool. Take meat off the bone and reserve the liquid. When the liquid is cool, skim the fat and reserve the juice. Use meat and juice in the following recipes: [Tomato Sauce With Lamb and Pasta](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014428-tomato-sauce-with-lamb-and-pasta); [Indian Lamb Curry With Basmati Rice](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014429-indian-lamb-curry-with-basmati-rice); [Chinese Braised Lamb Shanks](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014430-chinese-braised-lamb-shanks).
