This homemade Caesar Salad Dressing will elevate your salad to a whole new level. It's rich, tangy, and incredibly easy to make. 

### Ingredients

* `2` small garlic cloves, minced
* `1 tsp` anchovy paste (found near the canned tuna in the supermarket)
* `2 tbsp` freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon
* `1 tsp` Dijon mustard (I like the brand Maille)
* `1 tsp` Worcestershire sauce
* `1 cup` mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's Real
* `1/2 cup` freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
* `1/4 tsp` salt
* `1/4 tsp` freshly ground black pepper

### Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce.
2. Add the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and whisk until well combined.
3. Taste and adjust to your liking. The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.
