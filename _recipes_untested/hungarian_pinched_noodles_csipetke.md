title: Hungarian Pinched Noodles (Csipetke)
---
Hungarian Pinched Noodles, also known as Csipetke, are a simple yet delicious addition to any soup or stew. These dumpling-like noodles are made from a basic dough and are boiled until al dente. They are particularly delicious in Hungarian Goulash.

### Ingredients

* `2 cups` all purpose flour
* `4` large eggs
* `1 tsp` salt
* `to taste` salt for boiling

### Directions

1. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour, eggs, and salt.
2. Knead by machine for 10 minutes until a smooth dough is formed. It should not be sticky or too dry.
3. Add a small amount of flour or water as necessary to form a smooth dough.
4. Remove dough from machine and knead several times on the counter.
5. Cover the dough in plastic and let rest for 20 minutes.
6. Pinch off small pieces of dough and put on a floured surface.
7. Bring pot of salted water to boiling. Drop noodles into boiling water as you stir to prevent sticking.
8. Boil until al dente.
9. Add to soups or stews.
10. If not using right away, toss with butter.

### Notes

- Noodles can be boiled directly in soups or stews instead of water.

The dough can be made in a food processor or all by hand.
