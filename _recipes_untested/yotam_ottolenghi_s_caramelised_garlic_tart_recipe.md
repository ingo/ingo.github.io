This caramelised garlic tart recipe comes from Chef Ottolenghi's book, Plenty. Plenty is a book about vegetables and interesting and inspiring ways to cook them. The tart makes a great brunch, lunch, dinner, party or picnic dish - a great all rounder. Making the caramelised garlic tart takes a little work, but is well worth the effort.

### Ingredients

* `13 ounces` all-butter puff pastry
* `3` medium heads garlic, cloves separated and peeled
* Water, as needed
* `1 tablespoon` olive oil
* `1 teaspoon` balsamic vinegar
* `3/4 tablespoon` superfine sugar
* `1 teaspoon` finely chopped fresh rosemary
* `1 teaspoon` finely chopped fresh thyme, plus a few whole sprigs
* Salt, to taste
* `4 1/4 ounces` soft, creamy goat cheese
* `4 1/4 ounces` hard, mature goat cheese
* `2` large eggs
* `1/2 cup` heavy cream
* `1/2 cup` crème fraîche
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Directions

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Roll the puff pastry into a circle to line both the bottom and sides of a 28cm (11-inch) fluted tart tin and line with the pastry. Onto the bottom of the pan, place a large circle of greaseproof paper and fill with a layer of dry baking beans or rice. Place the tart into the fridge for approximately 20 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/Gas Mark 4 and bake the pastry case for 20 minutes, remove both the beans and paper and bake for another 5 minutes so the pastry is cooked and golden but not over-browned. Remove from the oven and leave to one side.
4. While the tart case is cooking, place the garlic cloves in a small saucepan. Cover with cold water and bring to a gentle simmer, cook for 3 minutes then drain through a colander or sieve.
5. Wipe the saucepan dry then add the cloves and olive oil and fry on a high heat for 2 minutes and no more. Add the balsamic vinegar, 1 cup of water and bring to the boil.  Simmer gently for 10 minutes.
6. After 10 minutes add the sugar, rosemary, chopped thyme and ¼ teaspoon salt and continue  to cook on a medium heat for a further 10 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the garlic cloves are coated in a dark caramel syrup. Set aside.
7. To assemble the tart: break both goat's cheeses into pieces and scatter in the pastry case and spoon over the garlic and any syrup.
8. Whisk together the eggs, creams, ½ teaspoon salt and some black pepper. Pour over the garlic and cheeses making sure that you can still see both on the surface.
9. Reduce the oven temperature to 320°F/160°C/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the tart filling has set and the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and leave to cool a little then take out of tin, lay the remaining thyme sprigs on top and serve warm Serve with a crisp salad. If eating later the tart does reheat very well.

### Notes

- The tart can be reheated if not consumed immediately.
