title: Rosemary Roasted Potatoes
---

This recipe for rosemary roasted potatoes is a simple yet flavorful side dish that pairs well with a variety of main courses. The rosemary adds a fragrant aroma and the roasting process brings out the natural sweetness of the potatoes.

### Ingredients

* `4` large potatoes
* `3 tbsp` olive oil
* `1 tbsp` rosemary
* `Salt and pepper` to taste

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Slice the bottom off each potato and cut crosswise at 1/8-inch intervals, cutting to within 1/4 inch of the bottom. (You can place the potato on a large spoon so the edges of the spoon prevent you from slicing completely through the potato.)
3. Place the potatoes in a large bowl, add the olive oil, salt and pepper and 1 tablespoon of the rosemary and toss well, working the salt mixture in between the slices. Arrange the potatoes on a sheet pan cut side up.
4. Bake the potatoes for 30 minutes, until they are tender and golden and crisp on top.

### Notes

- Ensure to slice the potatoes carefully to maintain their shape while allowing the flavors to permeate.
