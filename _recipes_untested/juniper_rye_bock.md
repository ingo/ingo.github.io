This beer recipe comes from the Brewers Publications book Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales & World-Altering Meditations in a Glass by Randy Mosher. It's a delightful blend of Nordic sahti and German bock, resulting in a deep amber, juniper rye bock.

### Ingredients

* `9.5 lb.` (4.31 kg) Munich malt
* `3 lb.` (1.36 kg) 2-row Pilsner malt
* `2 lb.` (907 g) malted rye or flaked rye
* `1 lb.` (454 g) dark crystal malt
* `1 lb.` (454 g) rice hulls
* `2 oz.` (57 g) Hallertau hops, 3.5% a.a. @ 90 min
* `4 oz.` (113 g) crushed juniper berries in the mash
* `2 oz.` (57 g) juniper berries (crushed) @ 90 min
* `2 oz.` (57 g) juniper berries (crushed) @ end of boil
* Danish Lager Yeast

### Directions

1. A standard infusion mash at 148°F (64°C) will work, but a traditional sahti stepped-mash infusion procedure is also a good option: 15-minute rests at 104°F (40°C), 130°F (54°C), 148°F (64°C), 172°F (78°C), and mash out at 190°F (88°C). The mash is generally raised from one temperature to the next by adding a small amount of boiling water, resulting in a very thin mash at the end.
2. Allow beer to mature for 4 to 6 months before enjoying.
