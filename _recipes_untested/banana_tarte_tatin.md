This Banana Tarte Tatin recipe is a delightful twist on the classic French dessert. Originally made with apples, this version uses bananas for a tropical flair. The recipe is vegan-friendly and is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.

### Ingredients

* `1/4 cup` unsalted butter or Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks
* `3/4 cup` firmly packed dark brown sugar
* `1 tsp` ground cinnamon
* `1/4 tsp` fine salt
* `6` medium bananas (enough to fill the skillet)
* `2 tbsp` dark rum, or 2 teaspoons rum extract
* `1 tsp` vanilla extract
* `1 cup` almond flour
* `2/3 cup` sorghum flour
* `1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp` sweet rice flour
* `1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp` potato starch
* `3 tbsp` granulated sugar
* `2 tsp` double-acting baking powder
* `1 tsp` xanthan gum
* `1/2 tsp` baking soda
* `1/4 tsp` fine salt
* `6 tbsp` cold unsalted butter (3⁄4 stick) or Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks, cut into 1⁄4-inch slices
* `1/4 cup` buttermilk
* `2` eggs, room temperature
* `1 tsp` rum extract
* `1/2 cup` shredded unsweetened coconut (optional)
* Caramel Sauce or Flavored Whipped Cream

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Melt the 1⁄2 stick of butter in a 9-inch skillet over medium heat. Stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Cook, swirling the skillet occasionally, until the mixture turns a medium amber color, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat.
3. Working quickly, cut the bananas into 1-inch-thick slices.
4. Arrange the bananas in the skillet with the ends facing up, working from the center outward. You should have enough to completely fill the pan (enjoy any leftovers as a snack). Drizzle the rum and vanilla over the bananas. Set aside.
5. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the almond flour, sorghum flour, sweet rice flour, potato starch, granulated sugar, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt. Pulse several times to blend the dry ingredients. Remove the lid and add the butter slices; pulse until the mixture is crumbly and resembles coarse meal. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl.
6. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, eggs, and rum extract, and beat well.
7. Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with a rubber scraper until the dough starts to come together.
8. Carefully spoon the dough over the bananas in big lumps. With dampened hands, smooth the surface of the dough, being careful of the hot skillet, and make sure that it is pressed right up to the edge. Place the skillet on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top is puffed and golden.
9. On a separate baking sheet lined with parchment, scatter the shredded coconut. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes in the same oven, on a separate oven rack, underneath the tart. Watch the shredded coconut carefully and remove it from the oven when it is golden.
10. Remove the skillet from the oven and place on a wire cooling rack. Let the tart cool for 30 minutes.
11. Place a serving plate over the top of the skillet and, using a kitchen towel, carefully invert the tart onto the plate. Sprinkle the shredded coconut over the top, if using. Serve with Caramel Sauce or Flavored Whipped Cream.
