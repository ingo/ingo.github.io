title: Lucky Peach's Chineasy Cucumber Salad
---
The editors of the popular food journal Lucky Peach are clearly big fans of Asian food. Their new cookbook shows you easy ways to make excellent Asian dishes at home, like this easy-peasy cucumber salad.

Cucumbers are best in the summer, but hothouse specimens are in the supermarket and in most of our refrigerators year-round. This is a treatment that will perk up even the most chemically enhanced wintertime cuke.

### Ingredients

* Cucumbers
* Black vinegar
* Chili
* Peanuts
* Cilantro (optional)

### Directions

1. Prepare the cucumbers.
2. Mix with black vinegar and chili to taste.
3. Top with peanuts and optional cilantro.

### Notes

- This salad takes cues from Xi’an cooking (specifically the kind channeled at restaurants like Xi’an Famous Foods and Mission Chinese Food), pinning down the cooling flavor of cucumber under a savory-sour blast of black vinegar and a sting of chili heat. Do not skip the peanuts; like the rug in The Big Lebowski, they really tie the room together. And feel free to amp up the cilantro if you’re so inclined.
