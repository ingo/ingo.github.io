### Ingredients

* `1 cup` water
* `1 cup` soy sauce
* `1 cup` brown sugar
* `4-5 tablespoons` of sesame oil
* `1 teaspoon` black pepper
* `2 tablespoons` (or 5-6 cloves) of fresh, finely minced garlic
* `3-4 shoots` of green onions, chopped into thin diagonal slices (to maximize surface area)
* short ribs cut perpendicular to the bone

### Directions

1. In a big bowl, add all ingredients except the meat. This is your marinade.
2. When washing the meat, do not over soak; just do a really quick rinse in and out of the faucet stream. You don't want to lose the natural flavor of the meat.
3. If you have your strips of short rib, dip each one fully immersed into the bowl of marinade, and take it out. Do the dipping process one by one. You just want the surface of the meat doused in the marinade, all the way around.
4. Once dipped, place the strip into a plastic container (like one of those rectangular rubber made Tupperware).
5. Continue the dipping process until you have all your short ribs stacked in the plastic container. DO NOT pour the rest of the marinade on top of the stacked ribs, because too much marinade takes the meat flavor out.
6. Close the plastic container and store in the fridge overnight. Do NOT marinate for any longer than 2 nights because the meat will get spoiled and the natural flavor would just diffuse into the marinade.
7. For a good indication, the morning after, check the color of the meat. The light brown color of the marinade should be barely penetrating the surface of the short ribs.
8. For cooking, place aluminum foil over a baking pan sheet and place in the oven, set it to broil. 5 minutes at 450 degrees.
