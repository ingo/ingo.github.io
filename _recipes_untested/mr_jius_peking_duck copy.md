Liberty Roast Duck combines the techniques of Beijing, Cantonese, and Sichuan roast duck for a perfect balance of crispy skin and tender meat. This dish celebrates Chinatown’s culinary traditions while incorporating unique methods such as air curing, smoking, and precise seasoning.

### Ingredients

* **For the Duck:**
  - 1 whole duck (6 lb / 2.7 kg), preferably with head attached
  - 4 qt (3.8 L) water
  - 2 cups (480 mL) distilled white vinegar, plus more for brushing
  - 1 cup (140 g) kosher salt
  - 1½ cinnamon sticks
  - 2 tsp juniper berries
  - 1 tsp allspice berries
  - 3 black cardamom pods
  - 1 tsp green peppercorns
  - 2½ star anise pods
  - 3 Tbsp brown rice syrup
  - 1½ tsp dark soy sauce
  - 1 tsp 10-Spice mix (see page 36 of the source book)

* **For the Duck Liver Mousse:**
  - 1 lb (450 g) duck livers
  - 1 Tbsp neutral oil
  - Kosher salt
  - ½ cup (30 g) thinly sliced green onions
  - ¼ cup (30 g) diced shallots
  - 4 tsp light soy sauce
  - 1 tsp Shaoxing wine
  - 1 Tbsp 10-Spice mix
  - 1¼ cups (275 g) unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces, at room temperature

* **For the Garnishes:**
  - 1 Persian or small pickling cucumber, thinly sliced
  - ⅓ cup (80 mL) rice vinegar
  - 3 Tbsp water
  - 2½ tsp granulated sugar
  - 2½ tsp kosher salt
  - Flake salt
  - ¼ cup (15 g) thread-cut green onions
  - Cilantro for garnish
  - 16 Chinese Pancakes, warmed
  - Peanut Butter-Hoisin Sauce (see page 37 of the source book)

### Directions

1. **Prep the Duck:**
   - Remove gizzards and any large pockets of fat. Use tweezers to pluck out pin feathers.
   - Separate the skin from the meat using a bicycle pump inserted between the breast meat and skin.
   - Remove the feet, wings, and thigh bones for an even roast.

2. **Blanch the Duck:**
   - Prepare a blanching liquid with water, vinegar, kosher salt, cinnamon, juniper berries, allspice berries, cardamom, peppercorns, and star anise.
   - Submerge or ladle the liquid over the duck until the skin is taut and slightly cooked, about 10 seconds.
   - Brush the duck with vinegar and pat dry.

3. **Air Cure the Duck:**
   - Mix brown rice syrup, soy sauce, and 10-Spice. Brush the mixture over the duck.
   - Place the duck on a rack, breast-side up, and refrigerate for 10-14 days to air dry, dumping any liquid that collects.

4. **Prepare the Duck Liver Mousse:**
   - Trim veins from the duck livers and season lightly with salt.
   - Sauté livers with oil in a hot pan until just pink. Blend with green onions, shallots, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, 10-Spice, and butter until smooth. Chill until ready to serve.

5. **Cook the Duck:**
   - Temper the duck for at least 8 hours before roasting.
   - Smoke the duck with applewood chips for additional flavor.
   - Roast at 375°F for 30 minutes, then finish at a higher temperature to crisp the skin.

6. **Prepare Garnishes:**
   - Combine rice vinegar, water, sugar, and salt to make a quick pickle for cucumbers. Serve cucumbers with sliced green onions and cilantro.

7. **Carve and Serve:**
   - Carve the duck, keeping the skin intact with the meat. Sprinkle with flake salt.
   - Serve with garnishes, pancakes, peanut butter-hoisin sauce, and mousse for diners to assemble.

### Notes

- Air curing is essential for achieving crispy skin—allow enough time.
- The duck liver mousse can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 3 days.
- Use a fan or natural air circulation to ensure the duck dries evenly during the curing process.
