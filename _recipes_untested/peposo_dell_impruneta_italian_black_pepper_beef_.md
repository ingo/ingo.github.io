title: Peposo dell'Impruneta (Italian Black Pepper Beef)
---
This recipe, found on the Food Wishes YouTube Channel, is all about the WOW! You will definitely be surprised by the amount of black pepper it uses, but once it is braised for several hours it all mellows in a wonderful flavor with a little bit of heat on the finish.

The dish was traditionally made by the workers who made terracotta tiles in the city of Impruneta. They would place this stew into clay pots, and leave it in their still-hot kilns overnight, where it would be ready the next morning. Since they were often stuck using less than fresh meat, copious amounts of black peppercorn was used to make the beef palatable.

### Ingredients

* `6` bone-in beef short ribs (about 8 to 10 ounces each)
* `1 tbsp` kosher salt to coat the beef
* `8` cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
* `1 tbsp` tomato paste
* `2 tbsp` black peppercorns, freshly crushed
* `1 tbsp` freshly ground black pepper
* `3-4` sage leaves
* `3-4` small sprigs rosemary
* `2 cups` red wine, preferably Chianti
* `2` bay leaves
* Salt to taste, to adjust sauce

### Directions

1. Simmer on low, covered, about 3 1/2 hours, or until fork tender. Turn occasionally.

### Chef's Tips

* If you don’t have a tight fitting lid for your large skillet or dutch oven, seal the top with aluminum foil and then cover with the existing lid and crimp the edges of the foil. This really helps keep all the moist, juicy, goodness inside over the long cooking time.
* You can substitute a simple pot roast from the grocery, instead of the short ribs. Just cut the roast into about 6 large chunks.
* Strain the sauce at the end before cooking it down as the rosemary might have disintegrated.
* Serve over polenta to capture all the juices and the flavor they bring to the dish.
