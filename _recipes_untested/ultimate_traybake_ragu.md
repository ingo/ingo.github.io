This recipe is from the book "Ottolenghi FLAVOUR" which focuses on unlocking the complex flavour in simple vegetables. It also happens to be extremely easy to throw together, and can be served with pasta or used as the base for a lasagne or shepherd's pie. 

### Ingredients

* `3` carrots, peeled and chopped into large chunks
* `2` onions, peeled and chopped into large chunks
* `300g` oyster mushrooms, roughly chopped
* `60g` dried porcini, roughly blitzed
* `4` garlic cloves, crushed
* `3–4` plum tomatoes, chopped into large chunks
* `120ml` olive oil
* `70g` white miso paste
* `40g` rose harissa (adjust according to the brand you are using)
* `4 tbsp` tomato paste
* `90ml` soy sauce
* `2 tsp` cumin seeds, crushed
* `180g` dried brown or green lentils
* `100g` pearl barley
* `1 litre` vegetable or chicken stock
* `160g` coconut cream
* `100ml` red wine
* Salt and black pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.
2. Working in batches, put the first six ingredients into a food processor and pulse until everything is very finely chopped (or very finely chop everything by hand if you don’t have a food processor).
3. Put the chopped vegetables into a large, 36cm x 28cm non-stick high-sided baking tray with the oil, miso, harissa, tomato paste, soy sauce and cumin seeds and mix very well. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring halfway through, until browned around the edges and bubbling.
4. Reduce the heat to 180°C fan.
5. Add all the remaining ingredients to the tray, along with 150ml of water, ⅓ teaspoon of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper. Stir very well, scraping the crispy sides and bottom with a spatula. Cover tightly with foil and bake for another 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for a final 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes for the sauce to be absorbed a little before serving.
