This Moroccan Lamb or Beef Tagine with Eggplant is a traditional dish that is rich in flavors and textures. The combination of tender meat and eggplant with a variety of spices creates a unique taste that is both satisfying and comforting.

### Ingredients

* `1 1/2 pounds` eggplant (4 small or 2 medium-large)
* `1/3 cup` olive oil
* `1` large onion (sliced or chopped)
* `3 cloves` garlic (finely chopped or pressed)
* `1` large tomato (grated, optional)
* `1` cinnamon stick
* `1/4 cup` chopped parsley (and/or cilantro)
* `1 1/2 pounds` lamb, beef (or goat meat, cut into 3-inch pieces)
* `1 1/2 teaspoons` salt
* `1 teaspoon` ginger
* `1/2 teaspoon` pepper
* `1/4 teaspoon` turmeric
* `1/4 teaspoon` saffron threads (crumbled)
* `1/2` a preserved lemon (quartered, optional)
* Garnish: chopped parsley (or cilantro)

### Directions

1. Trim the stems and ends from the eggplants. Partially peel the eggplants, leaving strips of skin which run lengthwise, creating a striped effect. Cut the eggplants lengthwise into quarters. If the eggplants are large, you can cut them into sixths or eighths lengthwise, and then cut those pieces in half to reduce their length. Place the eggplant flesh side up on a tray lined with paper towels and salt generously. Set the eggplant aside while you begin preparing the meat.
2. Pour the olive oil into the base of a tagine. Arrange the onion slices across the bottom and distribute the garlic on top. Add the tomato (if using), the cinnamon stick, the parsley and cilantro, and the meat bone-side-down.
3. Sprinkle the remaining spices as evenly as possible over the meat and onions and add about 2 cups of water. Cover the tagine and place on a diffuser over medium-low heat and allow the tagine to reach a simmer. This can take some time so be patient.
4. Once a simmer is achieved, reduce the heat to the lowest temperature necessary to maintain the simmer, and cook for 1 1/2 hours.
5. Rinse the eggplant, arrange it skin side up around the meat, add the preserved lemon at this time if using, and a little more water if feel it's necessary, and continue cooking the tagine, covered, for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the meat is very tender and can be broken with the fingers.
6. If necessary, reduce the sauce. Discard the cinnamon stick, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve the tagine directly from the cooking vessel.
