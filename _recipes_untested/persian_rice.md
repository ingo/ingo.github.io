### Ingredients

* `1 lb.` basmati rice
* `4 tbsp.` butter (softened)
* `3 tbsp.` salt

### Directions

1. Wash basmati in several changes cold water. Drain well. Fill a large nonstick pan with 2 quarts water and salt. Bring to boil. Add rice and cook at a vigorous boil 6-10 minutes. You want the rice just slightly underdone.

2. Drain rice well and rinse under lukewarm water. Place 2 tbsp. butter in the pan and add 1 cup rice. Mix well with a spatula. Add remaining rice, and mix in remaining butter. Spread a clean dishcloth or stack of paper towels over the top of the pot, and cover tightly with a lid.

3. Put rice on high for a few minutes (let it go a little longer than you might think), and then turn heat to very low. Steam 20-30 minutes, until grains are tender and separate.

4. To serve, invert pan over a plate so the crunchy part (the "tah dig") is on top. This is served as a delicacy to guests.
