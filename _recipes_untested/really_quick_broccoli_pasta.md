This is one of my best **emergency quick dinner ideas** and 2\-in\-1 veg plus carb **side dish.**  Broccoli, pasta and not much else, it’s a little bit lemony, a little bit cheesy and a whole lot of yum. The broccoli is cooked with the pasta then stirred vigorously with sauce to make it juicy and saucy.

### Ingredients

* `350g / 12 oz` dried short pasta (I used small shells)
* `2` broccoli heads (BIG!)
* `1 cup` shredded cheese (or more!)

#### Pasta Sauce (Notes for subs):

* `2 tsp` lemon zest
* `2 tbsp` lemon juice (or more!)
* `5 tbsp` extra virgin olive oil
* `1/3 cup` parmesan, finely grated
* `2` garlic cloves, minced
* `1 tsp` mixed dried herbs (or fresh!)
* `1/2 tsp+` red pepper flakes (add more if you want spicy!)
* `1 tsp` sugar
* `3/4 tsp` salt
* `1/2 tsp` pepper

#### Serving:

* More parmesan

### Directions

1. **Cook pasta:** Boil a large pot of water with 2 tsp salt, add pasta.
2. **Chop broccoli:** Chop broccoli into small florets.
3. **Cook broccoli:** Add broccoli into water 1 – 2 minutes before pasta is cooked.
4. **Sauce ingredients in jar:** Place Sauce ingredients in a jar with lid.
5. **Reserve pasta water:** SCOOP OUT 1 cup pasta cooking water just before draining. Then drain and return pasta back into same pot on turned off stove.
6. **Add pasta water into Sauce:** Add 1/2 cup pasta water to Pasta Sauce jar, shake well. 
7. **Add Sauce & Cheese to pasta:** Pour Sauce and add cheese into pot with pasta.
8. **Stir then serve!** Stir vigorously, adding more pasta water if required. Add more salt and pepper if required. Serve immediately, garnished with parmesan.
