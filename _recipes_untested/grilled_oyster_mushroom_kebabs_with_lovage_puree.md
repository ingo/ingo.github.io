This dish was inspired by the author's travels in South America, where he fell in love with the smoky, juicy flavors of Argentinian barbecue. The mushrooms are seasoned with sumac and cooked slowly over charcoal, resulting in a flavor that's as juicy, smoky, and almost as meaty as tender costillas. The mushrooms are served atop a bright puree of lovage, a minerally, almost salty green that tastes like a mix between overgrown parsley and celery leaves.

### Ingredients

* `1 pound` oyster mushrooms
* Grapeseed oil for coating
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* `1 teaspoon` ground sumac, plus more for dusting
* `2 tablespoons` Lovage Puree

### Directions

1. Slice the mushrooms off the cluster, leaving a very small amount of stem intact. Using a metal or soaked wooden skewer, thread the mushrooms through the stem, gill-side down, alternating the tops of the mushrooms from left to right, so they cook evenly. You should end up with two full skewers with about fourteen mushrooms on each.
2. Brush the mushrooms with a generous amount of oil to coat, making sure to oil the gills. Then lightly season with the salt, pepper, and ½ teaspoon of the sumac per skewer.
3. Preheat a charcoal grill to medium heat.
4. Place the mushrooms directly on the grill and cook, flipping the skewers every 2 minutes, for 8 to 14 minutes total, until the edges start to curl and brown, the mushrooms have shrunk significantly, and the stems are soft to the touch. The water will drip from the mushrooms onto the coals to create the smoke that will give them that smoky flavor.
5. When ready to serve, spread the lovage puree evenly over the center of a plate. Lightly dust the puree with the sumac and place the mushroom skewers on top.

### Notes

- Make sure to season the mushrooms only lightly with salt; they shrink a lot when they cook, concentrating the salty flavor. You can always add a bit of finishing salt at the end.

### Lovage Puree
**Makes about ½ cup**

#### Ingredients

* `8 cups plus 3 tablespoons` water
* `2 cups` loosely packed lovage, leaves picked
* `4 cups` packed spinach
* `2-inch piece` fresh turmeric, peeled, grated with a Microplane
* `1` garlic clove, grated with a Microplane
* `1 teaspoon` kosher salt
* `1⁄3 cup` crème fraîche
* `1⁄2 cup` Yogurt Whey
* `1 teaspoon` ground cardamom

#### Instructions

1. Bring 8 cups of the water to a boil in a large pot and fill a large bowl with ice water. Blanch the lovage in the boiling water for 2 minutes, then add the spinach and blanch for an additional 2 minutes. Using tongs, remove the greens from the pot and place in the ice water to shock for 2 to 3 minutes, until they are cool enough to handle. Using a colander or fine-mesh sieve, drain the greens, removing any ice. Using your hands, form the greens into a ball, squeezing out as much water as possible. Then place the squeezed greens in a kitchen towel. Wring out the kitchen towel until you remove as much liquid as possible and the greens are almost completely dry.
2. Place the greens in a blender and add the turmeric, garlic, salt, crème fraîche, whey, cardamom, and the remaining 3 tablespoons water. Mix on high speed, stopping to scrape down the sides when necessary, until the mixture is smooth. If the mixture won’t fully blend, add a little more water.
