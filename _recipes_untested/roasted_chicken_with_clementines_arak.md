### Ingredients

* `100ml` arak, ouzo or Pernod
* `4 tbsp` olive oil
* `3 tbsp` freshly squeezed orange juice
* `3 tbsp` lemon juice
* `2 tbsp` grain mustard
* `3 tbsp` light brown sugar
* `2` medium fennel bulbs (500g in total)
* `1` large organic or free-range chicken, about 1.3kg, divided into 8 pieces, or the same weight in chicken thighs with the skin and on the bone
* `4` clementines, unpeeled (400g in total), sliced horizontally into 0.5cm slices
* `1 tbsp` thyme leaves
* `2½ tsp` fennel seeds, slightly crushed
* salt and black pepper
* chopped flat-leaf parsley, to garnish

### Directions

1. Put the first six ingredients in a large mixing bowl and add 2½ teaspoons of salt and 1½ teaspoons of black pepper. Whisk well and set aside.
2. Trim the fennel and cut each bulb in half lengthways. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Add the fennel to the liquids, along with the chicken pieces, clementine slices, thyme and fennel seeds. Stir well with your hands then leave to marinate in the fridge for a few hours or overnight (skipping the marinating stage is also fine, if you are pressed for time).
3. Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. Transfer the chicken and its marinade to a baking tray large enough to accommodate everything comfortably in a single layer (roughly a 30cm x 37cm tray); the chicken skin should be facing up. Once the oven is hot enough, put the tray in the oven and roast for 35-45 minutes, until the chicken is coloured and cooked through. Remove from the oven.
4. Lift the chicken, fennel and clementines from the tray and arrange on a serving plate; cover and keep warm. Pour the cooking liquids into a small saucepan, place on a medium-high heat, bring to the boil then simmer until the sauce is reduced by a third, so you are left with about 80ml. Pour the hot sauce over the chicken, garnish with some chopped parsley and serve.
