This tangy, light tomato sauce recipe hails from Veracruz, a Mexican state heavily influenced by Spanish cuisine since the 16th century. The sauce is traditionally spooned over red snapper (_huachinango_) and snook (_róbalo_, a brackish-water fish), the two most popular fishes of Veracruz. The heat of the pickled jalapeño reveals its Mexican origin, making it a perfect accompaniment to a variety of seafood dishes.

### Ingredients

* `1/4 cup` extra-virgin olive oil
* `6` finely chopped garlic cloves
* `1` large white onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups)
* `12` medium plum tomatoes (about 2 pounds), cored and finely chopped, or canned tomatoes with some juice
* `1/4 cup` capers in brine, drained, or salt-packed capers, rinsed
* `25` pimiento-stuffed olives, left whole or halved crosswise
* `2` bay leaves
* `1/2 tsp` dried oregano
* `1/4 tsp` dried marjoram
* `3` pickled jalapeños, cut into thin strips
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `1/4 cup` water

### Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large (12-inch) heavy skillet or sauté pan. Add the garlic and sauté until golden.
2. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. 
3. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. 
4. Add all the remaining ingredients, lower the heat, cover the pan, and cook at a lively simmer for 10 minutes. Taste for seasoning. The sauce should have a pleasant tang and a delicate aroma.
5. To serve: heat the sauce in a skillet until warm. Add fish steaks, shrimp, or shredded reconstituted salt cod. Cook very briefly, just 3 to 5 minutes.

### Notes

- Covered tightly and refrigerated, this sauce will keep well for 1 week.
