This recipe comes from the 2018 Beard Award–nominated cookbook, _State Bird Provisions: A Cookbook_, by Stuart Brioza, Nicole Krasinski, and JJ Goode. It's a modern take on the ancient Roman condiment, garum, using Red Boat Fish Sauce as a base and adding a variety of Asian aromatics and spices for a complex flavor profile.

### Ingredients

* `4 cups` fish sauce (preferably Red Boat brand)
* `1 cup` lime juice
* `1` lemongrass stalk
* `One 3-inch knob` ginger, peeled and cut into a few pieces
* `3` medium garlic cloves, peeled
* `6` whole cloves
* `3` dried Indian or Indonesian long peppers
* `One 3-inch piece` Ceylon cinnamon stick
* `1` whole nutmeg

### Directions

1. Combine the fish sauce and lime juice in a blender.
2. Cut off and discard the bottom 1 inch and top 5 inches from the lemongrass, remove the outer layer, and cut the lemongrass into about-2-inch pieces.
3. One by one, coarsely crush the lemongrass, ginger, and garlic in a mortar and transfer to the blender. Focusing on one spice at a time, coarsely crack the cloves, long peppers, and cinnamon stick in the mortar and transfer to the blender. Wrap the nutmeg in a kitchen towel, whack it with a heavy pan to crack into several pieces, and then add them to the blender. Pulse the mixture to break up the solids a bit more, 15 to 30 seconds.
4. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 1 month (the longer the better). Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.
5. Transfer the finished sauce to an airtight container and store in the fridge for up to 3 months.
