This Old-Fashioned Strawberry Cake is a perfect way to celebrate the season of the juiciest, sweetest strawberries. The recipe was created by Alison Roman, a renowned chef known for her simple yet delicious recipes.

### Ingredients

* Cooking spray
* `2 cups/290g` all-purpose flour
* `2 teaspoons/8g` baking powder
* `¾ teaspoon/3g` kosher salt
* `1 stick/4 ounces/115g` unsalted butter, at room temperature
* `⅓ cup/70g` granulated sugar
* `⅓ cup/75g` light brown sugar
* `1 teaspoon` vanilla extract
* `2` large eggs
* `¾ cup/180g` buttermilk
* `10 ounces/295g` strawberries, hulled and sliced ¼ inch thick (or halved blackberries, blueberries, pitted sweet cherries, sliced peaches, or figs)
* `3 tablespoons` demerara sugar (you can use granulated sugar in a pinch)

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray the bottom of a 9-inch cake pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper (either cut to fit the bottom, or leaving some hanging over the edges for easy removal). 
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together. 
3. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle (or in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer), beat the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla together on medium-high, periodically scraping down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything incorporates, until the mixture is pale, light, fluffy, and creamy, about 5 minutes. 
4. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. (This is a good time to scrape down the sides again.) 
5. Reduce the mixer speed to low and carefully add half the flour mixture, followed by half the buttermilk. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture and buttermilk, beating just until no large lumps remain. 
6. Using a spatula, gently fold in half the strawberries and transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan. Scatter with the remaining strawberries and sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake until the cake is puffed, deeply golden brown, and pulling away at the sides, 45–50 minutes. (It should spring back slightly when pressed in the center and appear fully baked where the strawberries meet the cake.) 
7. Let the cake cool completely before eating.
