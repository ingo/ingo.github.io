This recipe comes from Chef Ori Menashe of Los Angeles’ Bavel, and co-author of the cookbook Bavel: Modern Recipes Inspired by the Middle East. The turmeric chicken is one of the most beloved dishes at Bavel, widely described as the juiciest chicken you’ll ever eat. Chef Menashe first developed the recipe for a dinner party celebrating his daughter Saffron’s second birthday. He wanted an easy and delicious dish that would be low-maintenance, so that he would still have time to mingle with his guests. The discovery became this favorite.

  * `1 tbsp + 2 1⁄2 tsp` kosher salt
  * `1 tsp` freshly ground black pepper

* For the Toum
  * `14` large garlic cloves, roughly chopped
  * `2 tbsp` freshly squeezed lemon juice

### Directions

1. To make the yogurt, add the milk to a large saucepan or Dutch oven fitted with a dairy or probe-style thermometer and warm over low heat. Gently stir the milk with a spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent scorching, until the milk reaches 120°F. Add the starter to a small bowl. Once the milk reaches 120°F, add 6 tablespoons of the heated milk to the starter and gently stir to combine. Continue to heat the remaining milk in the saucepan until it reaches 180°F, occasionally stirring with a spatula while gently scraping the bottom and checking the temperature. Once the milk reaches 180°F, remove the pan from the heat and let the milk cool until it reaches 120°F. Add the starter mixture and gently stir to combine. Transfer the mixture to a yogurt maker or electric pressure cooker and incubate for 6 hours at 110°F. Gather a piece of cheesecloth about 10 inches wide by 16 inches long. Cut the cheesecloth lengthwise, unfold it, then refold it the opposite direction. Prepare three layers of cheesecloth in this way. Nest a fine-mesh strainer or chinois into a large container (bowl or plastic tub) so that it will stay upright without falling over, then line with the layered cheesecloth. After 6 hours, pour the incubated yogurt into the prepared strainer. Using kitchen twine, tie up the cheesecloth into a tight-enough bundle that it forces moisture out of the yogurt. Transfer the cheesecloth bundle to the refrigerator and let drain for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Once the yogurt has drained, transfer from the cheesecloth to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

2. To make the marinade, in a bowl, combine the ground turmeric, orange peel, fennel, cumin, coriander, garlic, and fresh turmeric. Add the orange juice, orange blossom water, and yogurt and stir to combine.

3. To prepare the chicken, season the cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper. Rub some of the marinade inside the cavity of the chicken. Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together. Evenly season the outside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the chicken on a sheet pan and let it sit, uncovered, at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then rub the marinade all over the outside. Transfer the sheet pan, uncovered, to the refrigerator and marinate overnight. When ready to cook, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours prior to cooking. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the chicken breast-side up on the rack of a roasting pan. Roast for 40 to 50 minutes (if the skin is browning too quickly, decrease the heat to 375°F), until the meat between the leg and thigh feels tender to the touch or using an instant-read thermometer placed in the thigh, the temperature reaches 160° to 165°F. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes to let the juices redistribute. Cut off the kitchen twine, carve, and serve with a side of toum.

4. To Make the Toum, combine the garlic, lemon juice, salt, and orange blossom water in a blender. Pulse on the lowest setting until just combined. In a slow and steady stream, add the oil while continuing to blend on low, gradually increasing the speed to medium-high until the mixture has fully emulsified. The consistency should be similar to mayonnaise with some soft peaks. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. The consistency will thicken slightly after refrigeration.

### Notes

- Make Your Own Yogurt: The star ingredient of this chicken is the yogurt, which acts as a brine, softening the meat so that you don’t get a dried out piece of meat. Chef Menashe suggests making your own yogurt, as it’s a little thicker and more acidic, ensuring that it really tenderizes the bird.
- Warm Up Your Chicken: Before you toss that chicken into the oven, make sure to take it out at least an hour and a half to two hours, so that it reaches room temperature. The inside and outside temperature of the chicken should match. This prevents dryness, and ensures an even roast.
- Preheat the Oven: Chef Menashe recommends that the chicken go into the oven at 450 degrees. Do not get impatient and toss it in before it’s ready, because that will also affect the chicken’s juiciness.
- Don’t Pat Down the Chicken: If you’ve ever read a traditional recipe for roast chicken, they advise that you really dry out the chicken. You don’t need to do that with this one. The yogurt caramelizes onto the skin, making it a little thicker, and allowing for maximum crispiness.
- Don’t Forget the Insides: The recipe specifically states to marinade both the outside of the chicken, and the inside. This is not a typo. Use your hand to make sure all of that fragrant mix coats the chicken’s cavity too.
