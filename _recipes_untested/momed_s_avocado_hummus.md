At the modern Mediterranean restaurant Momed (with locations in Atwater Village and Beverly Hills), owner Alex Sarkissian says the avocado hummus is one of the classic dishes that remains from when the first restaurant opened almost 10 years ago. The recipe flavors puréed avocados simply, with garlic, lime and lemon juice, tahini, cumin and a touch of salt. Sarkissian calls the hummus one of the “superstars” on the menu. “Everyone talks about it.”

### Ingredients

* `3` avocados, peeled and seeded
* `1` garlic clove, minced
* `¼ cup` lemon juice
* `¼ cup` lime juice
* `¼ cup` tahini
* `½ tsp` cumin
* `1 tsp` salt, or to taste

### Directions

1. In a food processor, combine the avocado, garlic, lemon and lime juice, tahini, cumin and salt. Purée the mixture until smooth. 
2. Taste and adjust the flavoring and seasoning if desired. 

### Notes

- This makes about 3 cups hummus, which should keep, covered and refrigerated, up to one day.
- The avocado hummus also tastes really good on toast.
