DEBUG: Using image prompt: A candid, documentary-style image of freshly baked Brunsli cookies, star-shaped and dusted with granulated sugar, resting on a parchment-lined baking tray. The cookies, with their slightly crisp bottoms and soft, gooey middles, are set on a rustic wooden table, bathed in warm, natural window light mixed with soft indoor lighting. The scene captures the joy of home baking, with a few crumbs and uneven edges adding to its charm.
